# Dungeon
Exploring a dangerous dungeon.

## Hazard
At the start of each *turn*, the Dungeon master will roll for *hazards*. 

### Burn
Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.

### Fatigue
Become *fatigued*. Anyone already *fatigued* takes 1 damage. 

### Shift
Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.

### Other
Other *hazards* include wandering monsters.

## Moving
One *turn* at a normal cautious pace will move from a hallway to a room, or vice versa. Traversing a very long hallway, very long room, a flight of stairs, or an obstical, will also take one *turn*.

### Slow
By crwaling, moving foobar takes one *turn*. Players automatically detect traps and move *silently*.

### Fast
Moving at a fast pass foobar. However, there are many penalties:
- Surprised by all encounters.
- Spring all traps.
- Create *loud* noise.
- Cannot map.
- Candles are blown out.
- Cannot check doors.

### Marching
WHile moving in narrow hallways, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the *front* and the *back* are significant. 

## Doors
Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a *shift*.

Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. 

### Checking Doors
Once per *turn*, a player can check a door. 

Each door can only be checked once. 

The Dungeon Master rolls a d6. 

- **Peephole:** If there is a peep hole, or cracks, +2.
- **Class:** If a player has a bonus from their class, add only the strongest bonus. 
- **Results:** A roll of 5 or more will reveal information. Revealing “nothing” or “darkness” is indicative of either a failure, or accurately assessing a dark quiet room

### Failing to open
Attempting to open a stuck, bared, or locked door fails *quietly*. 

### Breaking Doors
Physically destroying a door takes one *turn*, requires appropriate tools, and makes *loud* noise. 

## Talking
### Reaction Roll
When speaking with monsters, the Dungeon Master might ask for a reaction modifier. See Character p4

The Dungeon Master might make the roll at advantage or disadvantage, depending on the player’s actions.

A high roll will make the monsters more friendly. A low roll will make them more hostile. A very high or very low roll will also make them *bad* for one *round*. See Dungeon Master p15.

## Stealth

## Flashback
Each session, each player may have up to one flashback. The following are provided as suggestions.

In general, anything that could have been done in town can be done as a flashback.

### Purchase
Have gotten a particular item while shopping. 
### Conversation
Role play a brief conversation had before the adventure. 
### Backstory
Role play the origin of a character.

## Flee
Fleeing a dungeon is reckless attempt to escape a dungeon.

Once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. 

Each round, move foobar, then one character must take 1d4 damage. 
No *hazards* occur while fleeing.

## Other Actions

### Searching
Searching reveals non-obvious features. A search will always reveal everything it can.

Searching will also reclaim one half of ammo.

Seaching a hallway or small room generally takes four people one *turn*. The amount of time will increase and decrease coresponding to the number of people searching and the size of the area.

### Resting
Spending one turn resting will remove *fatigue*. 

Additionally, ignore the *fatigue hazard* while resting.
