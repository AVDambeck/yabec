# Conflic
## Basic
### Time
One *conflict* takes one dungron turn. Time within *conflict* measured in rounds.

At the end of the tenth round, and each round after, all creatures still involved in the combat take 1 damage.

### Mapping
During conflict, it's possible to reference a map, but adding to a map is impossible. The dungeon master will not make *map calls*. See page X

## Inititative

### Action
Each round, each combatant can take one *action*. See page X.

Players can go in any order they choose. After each player's action, an enemy take an action. If the player is *bad*, the enemy will go before the player instead.

### Movement
While not *bad*, each combatant can move once within a *zone*. Changing *zones* takes an *action*.

### Resolution
When there are many combatants, this is the suggested order:

1. Stunts
2. Melee attacks
3. Magic
4. Fleeing

## Actions
### Attack
Make an *attack*. See page X.

### Move
Move to an adjacent *zone*.

#### Sprint
*Move* three times. During the next round, you are *bad*.

#### Retreat
*Move*. Then begin *retreat*.

### Magic
Cast a spell or use a magic item. See Magic.

### Stunts
Other maneuvers are stunts. How they are resolved is up to the Dungeon Master. 

Stunts may not cause damage directly.

#### Suggestions
**Forced move:** a *hit* has a 3-in-6 chance of moving an enemy to an adjacent zone.
**Intimidation:** with a successful charisma check, its force enemies to make a moral check.
**Disarming:** a *hit* grants a dexterity check to disarm an enemy. 
**Sundering:** a *hit* deals one damage to the weapon or armor.

## Appendix

### Flanking
In a *melee*, if one side surrounds the other, the surounded side has a +4 penalty to AC. 

### En Passant
THe first time each *turn* that a combatant takes a *move* action, they may also make an *attack*
