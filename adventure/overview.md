# Overview

## Phases
There are four *phases*.

### Town
Players navigate an urban setting, often splitting up to do *downtime*, or go shopping. The *phase* ends when the players *depart* on an *adventure*.

### Delve
Players explore a dangerous dungeon. This *phase* alternates with *conflict*i, until the players leave the dungeon. Then *clean up*.

### Conflict
Players fight or flee from monsters. 

### Clean Up 
Handle experience, splitting treasure, and other loose ends. Either end the session here, or begin *town* again.
