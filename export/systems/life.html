<p>This section covers health, damage, and dying.</p>
<h2>Health Points</h2>
<p>Health points (HP) represent the ability to withstand injury and exaustion.</p>
<h3>Health Die (HD)</h3>
<p>Health dice are used to determine HP. Each class has a diferent HD. Monsters have a d8 HD.</p>
<h3>Rolliing Health</h3>
<p>When leveling up, roll a number of HD equal to your level. Add the bonus from <em>constitution</em> times your level. If the new total is greater than your current HP, it becomes your new HP.</p>
<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>Damage represents injury, exaustion, and wear. </p>
<h3>Slain</h3>
<p>When a creature takes damage equal to or greater tan its HP, it is <em>slain</em>,</p>
<p><em>Slain</em> minions and monsters instantly die. <em>Slain</em> PCs are <em>near death</em>; if not healed within one <em>turn</em>, they will die.</p>
<h4>Destruction</h4>
<p>if <em>slain</em> by fire, explosion, or magic, PCs instantly die and items are destroyed. </p>
<p>Magic items have a chance of miraculously surviving.</p>
<h4>Subdual</h4>
<p>If the final attack on a creature is made with a blunt weapon, they can be left non-leathally incapacitated, and <em>bad</em> undtil a <em>shift</em>.</p>
<h3>Item Damage</h3>
<p>Some items can become damaged. Items with four or more damage break completely. Magic items are immune to damage.</p>
<p>Each point of damage incurs a penalty:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> -1 to damage.</li>
<li><strong>Armor:</strong> +1 to AC.</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> -1 to any rolls made with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dwarves are able to repair items. See page X. LINK</p>
<h2>Healing</h2>
<p>Healing removes damage.</p>
<h3>Natural Healing</h3>
<p>One week of downtime heals 2d6.</p>
<h3>Bandaging</h3>
<p>Bandages can be applied to injuries less than 3 turns old.</p>
<p>Make an <em>intelligence</em> check. If you succeed, heal 1d6.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction:</strong> Bandaging takes one turn, and consumes a bandage. Each injury can only be bandaged once.</p>
<p>You may bandage yourself.</p>
<h3>Magical Healing</h3>
<p>Magic potions or spells can provid instantaneous healing.</p>
<p>When magically healing a <em>slain</em> character, they <em>dismember</em> with advantage.</p>
<h2>Saving Throws</h2>
<p>All characters and monsters can make <em>saves</em> to avoid the full effects of certain traps, spells, and attacks.</p>
<h3>Catagories:</h3>
<p>There are five saving throw catagories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death (D):</strong> When targeted by a death ray, or exposed to poison.</li>
<li><strong>Weird (W):</strong> When exposed to radiation or other worlds.</li>
<li><strong>Paralysis or Petrification (P):</strong> When targeted by an efect that paralyses or turns to stone.</li>
<li><strong>Blast (B):</strong> When target by dragon breath or explosions.</li>
<li><strong>Spells or magic (S)</strong> When targeted by a banefull spell or effect from a magic item. </li>
</ul>
<p>Each class has its own table denoting the <em>save</em> values based on the level. Monsters have their own table, see page X. LINK</p>
<h3>Checking</h3>
<p>You succeed if d20 &gt;= <em>save</em> value. </p>
<p>Success against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved. Otherwise, the effect has been entierly avoided or negated.</p>
<h2>Near Death</h2>
<p>Between life and death, there is a terrible void.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>After a full turn <em>near death</em>, characters die. </p>
<p>If a character takes any damage while <em>near death</em>, they die.</p>
<h3>Dismemberment</h3>
<p>When healed in <em>near death</em>, a character rolls for <em>dismemberment</em>. Roll a d20, and subtract <em>constitution</em>. Reference the table. If they survive, they heal 1.</p>

<h2>After Death</h2>
<h3>Burial</h3>
<p>Simple burial prevents the vody from being reanimated.</p>
<p>Temples will burry and bless the dead for free.</p>
<p>Creamation prevents reanimation and is impossible to undo.</p>
<h4>Rites</h4>
<p>If a cleric uses one turn to preform a blessing, the soul will pass peacefully.</p>
<p>When funerary rites are preformed, the character sheet must be ripped up. Players are encouraged to give eulogy, play music, and create intricate rituals.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>When a character dies, their companions can loot their body.</p>
<p>Money and items stored in town will be subject to a 15% estate tax to local government or temple, and then inherited by the next of kin or listed heir.</p>
<h3>Resurrection</h3>
<p>Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two weeks of bed rest, they have 1 HP, move at half the normal rate, can not carry <em>heavy</em>  items, cannot attack, cast spells, or use class skills. </p>
<p>Each time a character is resurrected, their <em>constitution</em> is reduced by 1. </p></body></html>
