<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>Mapping a complete dungeon level scores XP equal to 1000 times the depth of the level.</p>
<h2>Leveling Up</h2>
<p>When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player:
- Looks at the character’s class and notes any improvements in saving throws, AV, spells, etc. 
- Increase their health by one HD. LINK
- Gain an additional <em>week</em> of <em>downtime</em>. </p>
<h3>One Session Maximum</h3>
<p>Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level are lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level.</p></body></html>
