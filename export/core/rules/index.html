<h2>The Conversation</h2>
<p>You may be familitar with this concept from other ttrpgs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the Dungeon Master. </p>
<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>Yabec is designed around a series of <em>hooks</em>. <em>Hooks</em> are keywords shown in italics. They're designed to link naturally into eachother.
For example, on a <em>turn</em>, you get one <em>action</em>, which you use to <em>attack</em>. This results in either a <em>hit</em> or a <em>miss</em>. A <em>hit</em> can cause damage or a spell effect. Then the <em>turn</em> ends, and causes a <em>hazard</em>, such as <em>fatigue</em>, which might end a spell effect.</p>
<h2>Scheme</h2>
<p>There are four <em>schemes</em>. Each has its own chapter.</p>
<h3>Town</h3>
<p>Players navigate an urban setting, often splitting up to do <em>downtime</em>, or go shopping. The <em>scheme</em> ends when the players <em>depart</em> on an <em>adventure</em>.</p>
<h3>Delve</h3>
<p>Players explore a dangerous dungeon. This <em>scheme</em> ends when the players leave the dungeon. Then <em>clean up</em>.</p>
<h3>Conflict</h3>
<p>Players fight or flee from monsters. This <em>scheme</em> occers within a <em>delve</em>, or rarely, in a <em>town</em>.</p>
<h3>Clean Up</h3>
<p>Handle experience, splitting treasure, and other loose ends. Either end the session here, or begin <em>town</em> again.</p>
<h2>Player Roles</h2>
<p>There are several roles that players are encouraged to take on. Use a notecard or token to keep track of roles. Taking on a role grants a small XP bonus.</p>
<h3>Chair</h3>
<p>Once per session, either the Dungeon Master or a player can call "Open the adventure's council". That person is the <em>chair</em>. They will go some or all of the roles, asking for volunteers, or resolving conflicts. 
+50 XP.</p>
<h3>Score Keeper</h3>
<p>Keep track of <em>scores</em>, such as looted treasure, and defeated monsters. See experience.
+50 XP.</p>
<h3>Quater Master</h3>
<p><em>Chart</em> the path to the dungeon while in <em>town</em>, and keep track of torches, bandages, and other equipment.
+50 XP</p>
<h3>Scribe</h3>
<p>Keep track of the different monsters and traps, their behaviors, mechanics, and even their combat statistics (depending on the Dungeon Master's approach to metagaming).
+50 XP. If you write a session report, +100 more XP.</p>
<h3>Mapper</h3>
<p>Keep track of the layout of the dungeon. You might ask the Dungeon Master for exact <em>map calls</em>. See mapping.

<h3>Caller</h3>
<p>Get consensus on what the party would like to do, and communicate to the Dungeon Master.
