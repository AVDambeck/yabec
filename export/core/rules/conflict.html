<h2>Basic</h2>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>One <em>conflict</em> takes one dungeon <em>turn</em>. Time within <em>conflict</em> measured in rounds.</p>
<h4>Exaustin</h4>
<p>At the end of the 6th round, and each round after, all creatures still involved in the combat take 1 damage.</p>
<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>During conflict, it's possible to reference a map, but adding to a map is impossible. The dungeon master will not make <em>map calls</em>. See page X</p>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>While not <em>bad</em>, each combatant can move freely within a <em>zone</em>. Changing <em>zones</em> takes an <em>action</em>.</p>
<h2>Inititative</h2>
<p>The Dungeon Master can employ either of these two methods for initiative.</p>
<h3>Dramatic</h3>
<p>Each round, each combatant can take one <em>action</em>. Then they must wait for the next round to act again.</p>
<p>Players can go in any order they choose. After each player's action, an enemy take an action. However, if the player is <em>bad</em>, the enemy will go before the player instead.</p>
<h3>Ranked</h3>
<p>at the start of <em>conflict</em>, each player rolls a d10 and adds their <em>dexterity</em> score. this is their <em>count</em>. <em>Ordinary</em> monsters have <em>count</em> 13. <em>Powerful</em> monsters have <em>count</em> 18. </p>
<p>At the start of each <em>round</em>, the creature with the highest <em>count</em> takes one <em>action</em>. then proceed in decending order.</p>
<p>Ties between the players can be resolved in either order they please. players win ties against monsters, unless they are <em>bad</em>.</p>
<h2>bad</h2>
<p><em>bad</em> is a generalized status conditions. </p>
<p><em>attacks</em> and <em>stealth</em> against <em>bad</em> targets always succeed. </p>
<p><em>bad</em> creatures can:
- hear.
- speak.
- <em>Save</em>.
- Desperate actions allowed by <em>badness</em>. For example, move randomly in the dark, or move inches while bound.  </p>
<p><em>Bad</em> cretures can not:
- Move. 
- <em>Attack</em>.
- Cast spells.
- Use magic items.
- Use class skills.</p>
<p>Depending on the exact condition, <em>Bad</em> creatures might be able to take some limited action. For example, a blind creature may beable to move randomly, or a bound character might work to break out of their restraints.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<h3>Attack</h3>
<p>Make an <em>attack</em> with a weapon. See page X.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Cast a spell or use a magic item. See Magic.</p>
<h3>Move</h3>
<p>Move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>. See page X.</p>
<h4>Sprint</h4>
<p><em>Move</em> twice. During the next round, you are <em>bad</em>.</p>
<h4>Retreat</h4>
<p><em>Move</em>. You are now in-retreat:
- -2 AC bonus.
- <em>Attack</em> with <em>disadvantage</em>.
- Can not cast spells.
- If you do not <em>move</em> for a <em>round</em>, your retreat ends, and you are <em>bad</em> for one <em>round</em>.</p>
<h3>Flee</h3>
<p>If three or more <em>attacks</em> have <em>missed</em> you since last you took an <em>action</em> other than <em>move</em>, you escape the <em>conflict</em>.</p>
<h3>Stunts</h3>
<p>Other maneuvers are stunts. How they are resolved is up to the Dungeon Master. </p>
<p>Stunts may not cause damage directly.</p>
<h4>Suggestions</h4>
<p><strong>Forced move:</strong> a <em>hit</em> has a 3-in-6 chance of moving an enemy to an adjacent zone.
<strong>Intimidation:</strong> with a successful charisma check, its force enemies to make a moral check.
<strong>Disarming:</strong> a <em>hit</em> grants a dexterity check to disarm an enemy. 
<strong>Sundering:</strong> a <em>hit</em> deals one damage to the weapon or armor.</p>
<h2>Attacking</h2>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>The Armor Class (AC) is how likely a target is to be hit. </p>
<p>The Attack Value (AV), also called THAC0, is how likely an attack is to miss.</p>
<p>Lower AC and AV are better.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master might either announce the result of the <em>attack</em>, or tell you the AC/AV so you can announce it yourself.</p>
<h3>Making an Attack</h3>
<p>To make an <em>attack</em>, subtract a d20 from you AV. If it is greater than or equal to the AC, you <em>hit</em>. Otherwise, you <em>miss</em>.</p>
<h3>Dodging an Attack</h3>
<p>To dodge an attack, roll a d20 and add your AC. if it is less than or equal to the AV, the attack is a <em>miss</em>. Otherwise, it is a <em>hit</em></p>
<h2>Appendix</h2>
<h3>Flanking</h3>
<p>In melee, if one side surrounds the other, the surounded side has a +4 penalty to AC. </p>
<h3>Friendly Fire</h3>
<p>A missed ranged attack has a 3-in-6 chance to hit an ally engaged in melee.</p>
<h3>En Passant</h3>
<p>The first time each <em>turn</em> that a combatant takes a <em>move</em> action, they may also make an <em>attack</em></p>
<h3>Subdual</h3>
<p>If a creature is <em>slain</em> with a blunt weapon, they can be left non-leathally incapacitated, and <em>bad</em> until a <em>shift</em>.</p></body></html>
