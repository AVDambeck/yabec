<p>Exploring a dangerous dungeon.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>Each <em>action</em> will cause a <em>turn</em> to pass, possibly resulting in <em>hazards</em></p>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>Moving within a <em>zone</em> can be done freely. To change <em>zones</em> is an <em>action</em>.</p>
<h3>Marching</h3>
<p>While moving in narrow hallways, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the <em>front</em> and the <em>back</em> are significant. </p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>This is a non-exaustive list of the <em>actions</em> players might take in a dungeon.</p>
<h3>Move</h3>
<p>Move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>.</p>
<h4>Run</h4>
<p>Moving at a fast pace, players can move through 6 <em>zones</em> in one <em>turn</em>. However, there are many penalties:
- Surprised by all encounters.
- Spring all traps.
- Create <em>loud</em> noise.
- Cannot map.
- Cannot check doors.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>Searching reveals non-obvious features. A search will always reveal everything it can.
Searching will also reclaim one half of ammo.
Seaching a single <em>zone</em> takes four people one <em>turn</em>. The amount of time will increase and decrease coresponding to the number of people searching and the size of the area.</p>
<h3>Rest</h3>
<p>Spending one <em>turn</em> resting will remove <em>fatigue</em>. 
Additionally, ignore the <em>fatigue hazard</em> while resting.</p>
<h3>Bandage</h3>
<p>See page X</p>
<h3>Talk</h3>
<p>Begin a new <em>turn</em> at the end of the conversation.</p>
<h4>Reaction Roll</h4>
<p>The Dungeon Master might ask for a <em>reaction modifier</em>. See Character p4.
The Dungeon Master might make the roll at advantage or disadvantage, depending on the player’s actions.
A high roll will make the monsters more friendly. A low roll will make them more hostile. A very high or very low roll will also make them <em>bad</em> for one <em>round</em>. See Dungeon Master p15.</p>
<h3>Flee</h3>
<p>Recklessly try to escape the dungeon.
Once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. 
Each <em>round</em>, move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>, then one character must take 1d4 damage. </p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>
<p>At the start of each <em>turn</em>, the Dungeon master will roll for <em>hazards</em>. </p>
<p>Unless the players loose their clock, the Dungeon Master should knock on the table to indicate the <em>turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Burn</h3>
<p>Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.</p>
<h3>Fatigue</h3>
<p>Become <em>fatigued</em>. Anyone already <em>fatigued</em> takes 1 damage. </p>
<h3>Shift</h3>
<p>Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>Other <em>hazards</em> may include wandering monsters.</p>
<h2>Doors</h2>
<p>Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a <em>shift</em>.
Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. </p>
<h3>Checking Doors</h3>
<p>Once per <em>turn</em>, a player can check a door. 
Each door can only be checked once. 
The Dungeon Master rolls a d6. 
- <strong>Peephole:</strong> If there is a peep hole, or cracks, +2.
- <strong>Class:</strong> If a player has a bonus from their class, add only the strongest bonus. 
- <strong>Results:</strong> A roll of 5 or more will reveal information. Revealing “nothing” or “darkness” is indicative of either a failure, or accurately assessing a dark quiet room</p>
<h3>Failing to open</h3>
<p>Attempting to open a stuck, bared, or locked door fails <em>loudly</em>. </p>
<h3>Breaking Doors</h3>
<p>Physically destroying a door is an <em>action</em>, requires appropriate tools, and makes <em>loud</em> noise. </p>
<h2>Stealth</h2>
<p>PLACEHOLDER</p>
<h2>Flashback</h2>
<p>Each session, each player may have up to one flashback. The following are provided as suggestions.
In general, anything that could have been done in town can be done as a flashback.</p>
<h3>Purchase</h3>
<p>Have gotten a particular item while shopping. </p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>Role play a brief conversation had before the adventure. </p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Role play the origin of a character.</p></body></html>
