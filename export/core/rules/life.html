<p>This section covers health, damage, and dying.</p>
<h2>Health Points</h2>
<p>Health points (HP) represent the ability to withstand injury and exaustion.</p>
<h3>Health Die (HD)</h3>
<p>Health dice are used to determine HP. Each class has a diferent HD. Monsters have a d8 HD.
At 1st level, a character's HP is equal to the highest value on their HD.</p>
<h2>Healing</h2>
<p>Healing removes damage.</p>
<h3>Natural Healing</h3>
<p>One week of downtime heals 2d6.</p>
<h3>Bandaging</h3>
<p>Bandages can be used to gain some healing. Make an <em>intelligence</em> check. If you succeed, heal the target 1d6. You may bandage yourself.
Bandaging takes one <em>turn</em>, and consumes a bandage. Once you are bandaged, you can not be bandaged again until you are <em>fatigued</em>.</p>
<h3>Magical Healing</h3>
<p>Magic potions or spells can provid instantaneous healing.
When magically healing a <em>slain</em> character, they <em>dismember</em> with advantage.</p>
<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>Damage represents injury, exaustion, and wear. </p>
<h3>Slain</h3>
<p>When a creature takes damage equal to or greater tan its HP, it is <em>slain</em>,
<em>Slain</em> minions and <em>ordinary</em> monsters instantly die. 
<em>Slain</em> PCs and <em>powerful</em> monsters are <em>near death</em>. See Near Death.</p>
<h4>Destruction</h4>
<p>If <em>slain</em> by fire, explosion, or magic items are destroyed, and PCs and <em>powerful</em> monsters instantly die.
Magic items and monsters have a chance of miraculously surviving.</p>
<h3>Item Damage</h3>
<p>Some items can become damaged. Items with four or more damage break completely. Magic items are immune to damage.
Each point of damage incurs a penalty:
- <strong>Weapons:</strong> -1 to damage.
- <strong>Armor:</strong> +1 to AC.
- <strong>Other:</strong> -1 to any rolls made with it.
Dwarves are able to repair items. See page X. LINK</p>
<h2>Near Death</h2>
<p>Between life and death, there is a terrible void.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>After a full turn <em>near death</em>, creatures die. 
If a creature takes any damage while <em>near death</em>, they dismember.</p>
<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>When healed while <em>near death</em>, a creature instead rolls for <em>dismemberment</em>. If healed by magic, they roll with <em>advantage</em>.</p>
<h3>Dismemberment</h3>
<p>Roll a d12, and add <em>constitution</em> score. Reference the table. If they survive, they heal 1.</p>

<h2>After Death</h2>
<h3>Burial</h3>
<p>Simple burial prevents the vody from being reanimated.
Temples will burry and bless the dead for free.
Creamation prevents reanimation and is impossible to undo.</p>
<h4>Rites</h4>
<p>If a cleric uses one turn to preform a blessing, the soul will pass peacefully.
When funerary rites are preformed, the character sheet must be ripped up. Players are encouraged to give eulogy, play music, and create intricate rituals.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>When a character dies, their companions can loot their body.
Money and items stored in town will be subject to a 15% estate tax to local government or temple, and then inherited by the next of kin or listed heir.</p>
<h3>Resurrection</h3>
<p>Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two weeks of bed rest, they have 1 HP, move at half the normal rate, can not carry <em>heavy</em>  items, cannot attack, cast spells, or use class skills. 
Each time a character is resurrected, their <em>constitution</em> is reduced by 1. </p></body></html>
