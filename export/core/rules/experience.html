<p>This chapter covers experience points (XP) and how it is awarded. XP is a measure of a PC's power and wealth, and creates progression.</p>
<h2>Score Card</h2>
<p>At the start of the session, the Score Keeper will begin a score card: a simple piece of paper to write down <em>scores</em> as they happen.</p>
<p>At the end of the session, the Score Keeper will confer with the DM to confirm each <em>score</em>, and establish the total amount of XP. 
XP is divided evenly between all surviving characters. The Score Keeper will announce the individual amount gained.</p>
<h3>Prime Requisite</h3>
<p>Each class has one or two prime requisites, which grants bonus XP for having a high <em>ability score</em>.</p>
<p>Characters with at least a 9 in one prime requisite gain 5% extra XP. </p>
<p>Characters with at least a 9 in both gain 15% extra XP.</p>
<p>Characters with at least a 16 in one prime requisite gain 15% extra XP.</p>
<h3>Minions</h3>
<p>If players are 2nd level or higher, their minions  gain the same amount of XP. </p>
<h2>Scores</h2>
<p>A <em>score</em> is anything that awards XP.</p>
<h3>Treasure.</h3>
<p>Recovering treasure from a dungeon scores 1 XP per 1 cp value of the treasure.</p>
<p>Recovering a magic item scores 1000 XP.</p>
<p>Recovering a particular quest item scores 1000 XP.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Achieving a <em>goal</em> scores 100 XP per character involved.  LINK</p>
<p>Failing to achieve a goal reduces the XP from this score card by 100 XP. </p>
<h3>Defeated Monster</h3>
<p>Defeating monsters scores XP based on their HD, plus a bonus for each special ability. e.g. a 2+2 HD monster with an ability is worth 35 XP.</p>

<ul>
<li>Looks at the character’s class and notes any improvements in saving throws, AV, spells, etc. </li>
<li>Roll your HD and add it to your HP.</li>

<h3>One Session Maximum</h3>
<p>Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Leave the character 1 XP below the threshold for the next level. The remaining XP can be distributed among the other characters, as the player wishes. If all characters are 1 XP below the threshold, extra XP is wasted.</p></body></html>
