<p>This chapter covers how to track light, distance, and similar elements.</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Time is measured in three units. </p>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<p>Most adventuring activities, such as having a fight or searching a room take one <em>turn</em>. </p>
<h3>Round</h3>
<p>A <em>round</em> is a short unit of time used during conflict. There are 10 <em>rounds</em> in one <em>turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Week</h3>
<p>Each session, players get one <em>week's</em> worth of downtime. </p>
<h2>Zones</h2>
<p>The dungeon enviornment is split into <em>zones</em>. As a rule of thumb, each room and hallway is a <em>zone</em>. Large rooms or hallways may be multipule <em>zone</em>. </p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Architectual features, such as a doorway, should divide <em>zones</em>.</li>
<li><strong>40':</strong> Rooms bigger than 40', and hallways longer than 40', should be multipule <em>zones</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Even:</strong> Large rooms and hallways should have their <em>zones</em> divided evenly. </li>
<li><strong>Whole Number:</strong> Large rooms and hallways should always have a whole number of <em>zones</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ranges</h2>
<p>Ranges and relative location are divided into four <em>ranges</em>.</p>
<h3>Touch</h3>
<p>Striking distance. </p>
<h3>Close</h3>
<p>Throwing distance. Speaking distance. With in the same <em>zone</em>.</p>
<h3>Distant</h3>
<p>Shouting distance. Farthest distance to make out details (in <em>bright</em> light). </p>
<p>In dark environments, the player's torch will often be the limit of theire sight. This means that anything within torch light is <em>distant.</em></p>
<h3>Sight</h3>
<p>Anything that can be seen. Up to 3 miles in ideal conditions.</p>
<h2>Noises</h2>
<p>The are two kinds of noise: </p>
<h3>Silent</h3>
<p>Produces effectivly no sound; no effect.</p>
<h3>Loud</h3>
<p>Heard by <em>distant</em> listeners. Increases the chance of wandering monsters. Etc.</p>
<p>Most sounds are <em>loud</em> by default.
A <em>loud</em> sound can be made <em>silent</em> with <em>stealth</em>.</p>
<h2>Light</h2>
<h3>Levels</h3>
<p>There are three kinds of light:</p>
<h4>Dark</h4>
<p>The <em>darkness</em> is pitch black, and prevents sight. Imposess blindness.</p>
<h4>Dim</h4>
<p>Allows some detail to be seen.</p>
<h4>Bright</h4>
<p>Allows full vision, including details and reading. Disables <em>infravision</em>.</p>
<h3>Distant</h3>
<p>A light source casts <em>bright</em> light within <em>touch</em>, and <em>dim</em> within <em>distant</em>. </p>
<h3>Infravision</h3>
<p>A special type of vision had by many monsters: seeing heat energy that radiats of living things. </p>
<p>When a creature with <em>infravision</em> stands in <em>bright</em>, they are blinded for one round, and their <em>infravison</em> is disabled until they spend a full <em>turn</em> in the <em>dark</em>.</p>
<p>It is not possible to read in the <em>dim</em> or <em>dark</em> with <em>infravision</em>. </p>
<h3>Blindness</h3>
<p>Creatures who are unable to perceive their surroundings are <em>bad</em>.</p></body></html>
