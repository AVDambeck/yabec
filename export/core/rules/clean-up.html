<h3>Town</h3>
<p>When <em>clean up</em> is finished, return to <em>town</em> or end the session.</p>
<h2>Evaluate Loyalty</h2>
<p>At the end of each session the hirelings evaluate their loyalty.<br />
- If their boss chooses to pay their wages again, they gain one point. 
- If an animal or monster got to eat its favorite prey, they gain one point. 
- If a hireling died that session, non-monster hirelings loose one point.
- If a hireling or monster completed a goal, they gain one point.
- They may gain or loose more points at the referee’s discretion.
