<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>The Dungeon Master will present an overworld map with one or more dugeons, an possibly other towns. </p>
<h3>Deciding a destination</h3>
<p>Any player can contribute to the discussion of what dungeon to go to. However, only one player needs to <em>chart</em> the journey. 
Unopinionated players can simply follow the party to whichever dungeon they go to.</p>
<h3>Charting</h3>
<p>One players <em>charts</em> the journey to a dungeon or another town. Its suggest that this player be the <em>quater master</em>. See Roles.
1. Count the number of <em>hexes</em> between the party's current location, and the destination. 
2. Count the number of <em>hexes</em> to a town. 
3. (optional) If crossing an <em>obsticle</em>, such as a river, add each to the count. 
4. For each player and minion, aquire a ration for each <em>hex</em>. 
5. (optional) If crossing a body of water, also aquire the fare for passage on a boat.
Best practice is to have each participating player compensate the <em>quarter master</em> for their rations.</p>
<h3>Departing</h3>
<p>One player, ideally the Caller will announce "Adventuers to depart!". 
Once all players have confirmed they are ready to <em>depart</em>, the players travel to their destination. 
If it is a dungeon, change the <em>scheme</em> to <em>dungeon</em>.
If it is a different town, simply continue <em>town</em> in the new location.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Each session, the players may agree to set one goal for the party. If the goal has already been completed in the past, or is not difficult enough, the Dungeon Master may reject it.
Completing a goal scores experience. See Experience.
