<p>Try to get a better buy on your treasure.</p>
<p>Each week, you can find buyers for treasure equal to 100 cp times your level. If a single object is more valuable than that, you must work for several <em>weeks</em> to sell it.</p>
<p><em>True Merchant</em>: For each 1 <em>merit</em> spent, sell an additional 10% (compounding).</p>
<h3>Sale</h3>
<p>When you sell the item, roll d% on the table, and add your <em>charisma</em> score. </p>
<p>| d% | Sale |
| &lt;20 | Robbed! 0% |
| 20-29 | Low ball: 75% |
| 30-39 | Low ball: 90% |
| 40-89 | 110% | 
| 90-100 | 140% |
| &gt;100 | Swindler! 200% |</p>
<p>If you get a low ball, you can refuse to sell.</p>
<p>If you get robbed, ask your Dungeon Master for a lead on the thieves.</p>
<h3>Tax</h3>
<p>There is a 1% tax on sales over 500 cp.</p>
<h2>Service</h2>
<p>"Volunteer" at the temple.</p>
<p>Service is often done in payment for crimes, or to restore favor of a diety. </p>
<p>The first time you preform service, you gain no benifit. The second time, you gain one <em>merit</em>. The third and further times, you gain three <em>merit</em>, and can buy one boon, depending on your alignment.</p>
<h3>Lawful</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Unboon</em>: gain an additional 1d4-1 <em>merit</em>.</li>
<li><em>True Citizanship</em>: Costs 1 <em>merit</em>. Reduce the estate tax to 5%, for a character who died in the previous session, or wave any one tax this session.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Taming</h2>
<p>Mundane animals can be tamed by anyone. 
Druids, and Elves, can tame magical animals, and tame mundane animals twice as fast.</p>
<p>Choose the type of animal you want to find. It must be an animal common in the area your located in. You can also choose an animal you have already made progress with, or a rare animal you know the location of.</p>
<p>Each week, make two <em>charisma</em> checks, (Druids and Elves make four). For each you succeed, you gain one favor with the animal. </p>
<p>Once you gain a favor equal to 5 plus the HD of the animal, the animal becomes tamed. Then you can begin training it.</p>
<p>Each of the following skills costs a certain amount of favor:</p>
