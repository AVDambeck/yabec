<p>Exploring a dangerous dungeon.</p>
<h2>Hazard</h2>
<p>At the start of each <em>turn</em>, the Dungeon master will roll for <em>hazards</em>. </p>
<h3>Burn</h3>
<p>Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.</p>
<h3>Fatigue</h3>
<p>Become <em>fatigued</em>. Anyone already <em>fatigued</em> takes 1 damage. </p>
<h3>Shift</h3>
<p>Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>Other <em>hazards</em> include wandering monsters.</p>
<h2>Moving</h2>
<p>One <em>turn</em> at a normal cautious pace will move from a hallway to a room, or vice versa. Traversing a very long hallway, very long room, a flight of stairs, or an obstical, will also take one <em>turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Slow</h3>
<p>By crwaling, moving foobar takes one <em>turn</em>. Players automatically detect traps and move <em>silently</em>.</p>
<h3>Fast</h3>
<p>Moving at a fast pass foobar. However, there are many penalties:
- Surprised by all encounters.
- Spring all traps.
- Create <em>loud</em> noise.
- Cannot map.
- Candles are blown out.
- Cannot check doors.</p>
<h3>Marching</h3>
<p>WHile moving in narrow hallways, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the <em>front</em> and the <em>back</em> are significant. </p>
<h2>Doors</h2>
<p>Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a <em>shift</em>.</p>
<p>Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. </p>
<h3>Checking Doors</h3>
<p>Once per <em>turn</em>, a player can check a door. </p>
<p>Each door can only be checked once. </p>
<p>The Dungeon Master rolls a d6. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peephole:</strong> If there is a peep hole, or cracks, +2.</li>
<li><strong>Class:</strong> If a player has a bonus from their class, add only the strongest bonus. </li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> A roll of 5 or more will reveal information. Revealing “nothing” or “darkness” is indicative of either a failure, or accurately assessing a dark quiet room</li>
</ul>
<h3>Failing to open</h3>
<p>Attempting to open a stuck, bared, or locked door fails <em>quietly</em>. </p>
<h3>Breaking Doors</h3>
<p>Physically destroying a door takes one <em>turn</em>, requires appropriate tools, and makes <em>loud</em> noise. </p>
<h2>Talking</h2>
<h3>Reaction Roll</h3>
<p>When speaking with monsters, the Dungeon Master might ask for a reaction modifier. See Character p4</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master might make the roll at advantage or disadvantage, depending on the player’s actions.</p>
<p>A high roll will make the monsters more friendly. A low roll will make them more hostile. A very high or very low roll will also make them <em>bad</em> for one <em>round</em>. See Dungeon Master p15.</p>
<h2>Stealth</h2>
<p>PLACEHOLDER</p>
<h2>Flashback</h2>
<p>Each session, each player may have up to one flashback. The following are provided as suggestions.</p>
<p>In general, anything that could have been done in town can be done as a flashback.</p>
<h3>Purchase</h3>
<p>Have gotten a particular item while shopping. </p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>Role play a brief conversation had before the adventure. </p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Role play the origin of a character.</p>
<h2>Flee</h2>
<p>Fleeing a dungeon is reckless attempt to escape a dungeon.</p>
<p>Once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. </p>
<p>Each round, move foobar, then one character must take 1d4 damage. 
No <em>hazards</em> occur while fleeing.</p>
<h2>Other Actions</h2>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>Searching reveals non-obvious features. A search will always reveal everything it can.</p>
<p>Searching will also reclaim one half of ammo.</p>
<p>Seaching a hallway or small room generally takes four people one <em>turn</em>. The amount of time will increase and decrease coresponding to the number of people searching and the size of the area.</p>
<h3>Resting</h3>
<p>Spending one turn resting will remove <em>fatigue</em>. </p>
<p>Additionally, ignore the <em>fatigue hazard</em> while resting.</p>
<h3>Bandaging</h3>
