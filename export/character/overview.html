<h2>Basic Character Creation</h2>
<p>Choose one of the premade character playbooks.</p>
<p>Reccomended for first time players.</p>
<h2>Manual Character Creation</h2>
<p>Get a sheet of paper, or print out a character sheet, to record all of your cracter's details.</p>
<h3>Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Choose either one of these arrays, and assign them however you like to the six stats <em>strength</em>, <em>dexterity</em>, <em>constitution</em>, <em>intelligence</em>, <em>wisdom</em>, and <em>charisma</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>13, 13, 11, 11, 9, 9</li>
<li>16, 13, 10, 8, 6, 5</li>
</ul>
<h4>Optional: Rolling ability scores.</h4>
<p>If you wish, you can instead roll 3d6 six times to create a new array.</p>
<h3>Choose a Class</h3>
<p>There are many classes to choose from. Make sure you meet the requirements for that class.</p>
<p>Unless you choose a Demihuman class, you are a human.</p>
<h3>Determine Statistics</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the page for your chosen class available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your HP (health points) is equal to the maximum value of your class's Health Die.</li>
<li>Your AV (attack value) is on your class's progression table.</li>
<li>Your saving throws are on your class's progression table.  </li>
<li>Note class abilities, and choose spells. </li>
<li>Note the bonuses, or penalties, from your ability scores. See page X.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choose Alignment</h3>
<p>Choose whether you are  Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. See p5.</p>
<h3>Note XP and Level</h3>
<p>Characters start at 1st level with 0 xp.</p>
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>Start with 3d6x10 cp. Buy items from the basic item list. Each class also provides suggested collections of items, and their price.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p>Beneath the surface of everyday life, two primeval forces mingle. Their servants favor either the cosmic order, or the advent of a new one. Some find themselves neutrally or unaligned, choosing for their own ends, or for the end of balance. </p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Magic affects creatures differently depending on alignment. Divine spellcastes need to be especially aware of their alignment.</p>
<h3>Alignment Language</h3>
<p>Creatures automatically recognize a certain set of gestures, signs, and code words, pertaining to their alignment. This allows creatures of common alignment a measure of communication.
Creatures of a different alignment are likely to recognize an alignment language being spoken, but will not understand its content.</p>
<h3>Revealing Alignment</h3>
<p>Players must reveal their alignment to the dungeon master, but are not required to reveal to each other. </p>
<h3>Role Playing Alignment</h3>
<p>If the character acts too far out of their alignment, the referee may require them to change their alignment and suffer a penalty.</p>
<h2>Monstrous</h2>
<p>Monstrous characters face additional challenges: 
- They are not welcome in urban areas unless accompanied by a human, elf, or dwarf. 
- They can not employ human hirelings. 
- They do not automatically know the common language.
- They have a -2 to reaction rolls with non-monsters.
- When in sunlight, they have a +1 to AC, and AV.</p></body></html>
