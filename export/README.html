<p>yet another basic/expert clone</p>
<p>Yabec started as a way to codify the Old School Rennessance mix I was running at my table. It now is an open source project for others to work from.</p>
<h1>direction</h1>
<p>Yabec is under construction! I had been pushing the limits of what Libre Office can do. Right now, I'm working on moving towards a dynamic solution including databases, markdown, and css.</p>
<p>this has spawned a side project: (markuary book)[https://github.com/AVDambeck/markury-book]</p>
<p>Game data is stored either directly in markdown, or markdown is genorated via python. Then that markdown is converted to html, mixed with css, and rendered into a pdf for printing. </p>
<p>There are three intended distribution points:
1. Raw markdown: intended for nerds.
2. Print, via pdf: to be used at game tables.
3. Hypertext: for web.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>what kind of system is yabec? what can you expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>4 basic classes, plus lots of extras</li>
<li>Apocolypse style player sheets (coming soon)</li>
<li>b/x math</li>
<li>hazard die</li>
<li>relative distances</li>
<li>mapping guides</li>
<li>player roles</li>
<li>object oriented hooks for bite sized rules</li>
<li>dynamically linked item and spell info</li>
</ul>
<h1>Printing</h1>
<p>Yabec is designed to exist at a physical game table in a bunch of little notebooks. Under the distribution dir, there are print files for each of these booklets.</p></body></html>
