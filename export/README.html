<p>yet another basic/expert clone</p>
<p>Yabec started as a way to codify the Old School Rennessance mix I was running at my table. It now is an open source project for others to work from.</p>

<h2>From version 1.x to version 2.x</h2>
<p>Changes fall into four broad catagories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the game simpler and easier to run, play, and write.</li>
<li>Giving playes more agency.</li>
<li>Making the early game more forgiving and transperent. </li>

</ol>
<p>These are the most significant changes.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Direction</h1>
<p>Yabec is under construction! The rules section is mostly finished. </p>
<p>A lot of effor has been put into develoing a new workflow with markdown and weasyprint. This solution is dynamic and enables me to include a greater variety of functions. See (markuary book)[https://github.com/AVDambeck/markury-book]</p>
<p>Game data is stored either directly in markdown, or markdown is genorated via python. Then that markdown is converted to html, mixed with css, and rendered into a pdf for printing. </p>
<p>There are three intended distribution points:
1. Raw markdown: intended for nerds who want to fork yabec.
2. Print, via pdf: to be used at game tables.
3. Hypertext: for web.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>what kind of system is yabec? what can you expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>4 basic classes, plus lots of extras</li>
<li>Apocolypse style player sheets (coming soon)</li>
<li>b/x math</li>
<li>hazard die</li>
<li>relative distances and zones</li>
<li>mapping guides</li>
<li>player roles</li>
<li>object oriented hooks for bite sized rules</li>
<li>dynamically linked item and spell info (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Printing</h1>
<p>Yabec is designed to exist at a physical game table in a bunch of little notebooks. Under the distribution dir, there are print files for each of these booklets.</p></body></html>
