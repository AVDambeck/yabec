<p>Global coverers broad aspects of the system, such as light and damage. </p>
<p>This chapter covers the basic outline of the system, including its foundational principles.</p>
<h2>Booklets</h2>
<p>This game is split into many booklets, so that they can be shared at an IRL game table. This hierarchy is also used to organize the hypertext version of this game.</p>
<p>This list describes each of the booklet's content.</p>

<h2>Player Roles</h2>
<p>There are a few roles which should be filled by players. These roles should be decided during warm up, but may change through the session.</p>
<h3>Score Keeper</h3>
<p>The score keeper keeps track of the XP gained during the session. See page X.</p>
<h3>Mapper</h3>
<p>At least one player should draw a map of the area based on the Dungeon Master’s description. For full procedure, see page X.</p>
<h3>Optional Roles</h3>
<h4>Caller</h4>
<p>With a large number of players, one playuer can be appointed as a representitive to report the actions of the players to the DM, especially during combat. </p>
<h4>Director</h4>
<p>The players may wish to appoint a director, to suggest an overall course of action, and to makes sure all players are given consideration in actions.</p>
<h4>Scribe</h4>
<p>The player may wish to appooint a scribe to keep track of different organizations, as well as the behavior and statistics of monsters, traps, dungeons, and other details.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>I see all ttrpgs as essentiall equal. However, it is essential to customize the game to suit the feel of the game, and the preferences of the players, and direction of the DM.</p>
<p>This is a system I wrote to support my first major game after the pandemic. It has influence from a lot of other games, as well as the OSR at large.</p>
<h3>Old School Renasiassance</h3>
<p>This is essentially a hack of B/X. I started running vintage modules after playing in a game of <em>Old School Essentials</em>. I found myself moving away from vintage modules, towards a more renasaissnce game. </p>
<h3>Chunked</h3>
<p>The rules should be delived in byte sized chunks, such that they can be taught quickly, and make way for the real game. </p>
<p>Players don't need to read the entire rule book. Instead, they are able to learn as they go.</p>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>My game is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A west-marches dungeon-crawler.</li>
<li>Run by a DM.</li>
<li>Set in sword and sorcery.</li>
<li>Played in 3-6 hour sessions.</li>
<li>Has one or more groups meeting regularly.</li>
<li>Has a campaign that lasts several months.</li>
</ul>
<p>This game may also be appropiot for similar dungeon-crawlers in other formats and settins, with some tweaks. For example, sci-fi equipment and classes are being planned.</p>
<h3>Dungeon</h3>
<p>The dungeon is a restricted environment in which play happens. </p>
<h2>Pillars</h2>
<p>This game is actually many smaller games, woven into each other with narrative.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Networking:</strong> Recruit interested friends to challenge the dungeon.</li>
<li><strong>Roleplay:</strong> Collaborative imagination through conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Die Rolls:</strong> Try to roll a target number.</li>
<li><strong>Combat:</strong> A light war game. Reduce the enemy's resources before theyreduce you.</li>
<li><strong>Puzzles:</strong> Problem without a clear solution. </li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Each item and spell is a possible solution. Which will you bring?</li>
<li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Discover a fictional world, exploring it from the POV of a character.</li>
<li><strong>World Building:</strong> Not just for the DM; players develop their characters, and the towns and guilds they are a part of.</li>
<li><strong>Progression:</strong> Slowly become more powerful and skilled adventures.</li>
<li><strong>Solo:</strong> Individual activies, such as independant delving, or downtime.</li>
