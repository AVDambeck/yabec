<p>This chapter covers how to track light, distance, and similar elements.</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Time is measured in three units. How long these units are is upto the DM.</p>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<p>Most adventuring activities, such as having a fight or searching a room take one <em>turn</em>. Each <em>turn</em>, the DM checks for hazards. </p>
<h3>Round</h3>
<p>A <em>round</em> is a short unit of time used during conflict. There are 10 <em>rounds</em> in one <em>turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Week</h3>
<p>Each session, players get one <em>week's</em> worth of downtime. </p>
<h2>Distance</h2>
<p>There are three units of distance. </p>
<h3>Step</h3>
<p>PLACEHOLDER</p>
<p>A <em>step</em> is an abstract measure of distance. Moving from a hallway to a room, or vice versa, is five <em>steps</em> under typical conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving to a door.</li>
<li>Crossing a threshold.</li>
<li>Moving down the hallway.</li>
<li>Moving further down the hallway. </li>
<li>Crossing a threshold.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are also one <em>step</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traversistairs or a ladder.</li>
<li>Traversing a simple obstacle.</li>
<li>Traversing between two <em>zones</em>, in a large area.</li>
<li>Traveling about 2 squares.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Squares</h3>
<p>The exact number of map squares can be counted to determine more exact distance. This is especially helpful if playing on a large battle map.</p>
<h3>Feet</h3>
<p>Rarely, distance will be measured in feet, especially in spell descriptions.</p>
<h2>Zones</h2>
<p>Ranges and relative location are divided into four <em>zones</em>.</p>
<h3>Touch</h3>
<p>Touching distance. In the same square.</p>
<h3>Close</h3>
<p>Throwing distance. Speaking distance. About 1 step. About 2 squares. </p>
<h3>Distant</h3>
<p>Shouting distance. Farthest distance to make out details (in <em>bright</em> light). Bow distance. About 5 steps. About 10 squares.</p>
<p>In dark environments, the player's torch will often be the limit of theire sight. This means that anything within torch light is <em>distant.</em></p>
<h3>Sight</h3>
<p>Anything that can be seen. Up to 3 miles in ideal conditions.</p>
<h2>Noise</h2>
<p>The are kinds of noise: </p>
<h3>Silent</h3>
<p>Produces effectivly no sound; no effect.</p>
<h3>Loud</h3>
<p>Heard by <strong>distant</strong> listeners. Increases the chance of wandering monsters. Etc.</p>
<p>Most sounds are <em>loud</em> by default.</p>
<p>A <em>loud</em> sound can be made <em>silent</em> with <em>stealth</em>.</p>
<h2>Light</h2>
<h3>Levels</h3>
<p>There are three types of light:</p>
<h4>Dark</h4>
<p>The darkness is pitch black, and prevents sight. Imposess blindness.</p>
<h4>Dim</h4>
<p>Allows some detail to be seen.</p>
<h4>Bright</h4>
<p>Allows full vision, including details and reading. Disables <em>infravision</em>.</p>
<h3>Light Power</h3>
<p>A light source casts for a number of steps equal to its light power (or four times that many squares). Half of that light is <em>bright</em> and half of it is <em>dim</em>. </p>
<p>| Source  | Power |
|-------- |-------|
| Candle  | 1/2   |
| Langern | 1     |
| Magic   | 2     |
| Torch   | 2     |</p>
<h3>Burn</h3>
<p>When the DM announces <em>burn</em>, torches burn out, and lanterns need new oil. </p>
<h3>Blindness</h3>
<p>Creatures who are unable to perceive their surroundings are <em>bad</em>.</p>
<h3>Infravision</h3>
<p>A special type of vision had by many monsters: seeing heat energy that radiats of living things. </p>
<p>When a creature with <em>infrabision</em> stands in <em>bright</em>, they are blinded for one round, and their <em>infravison</em> is disabled until they spend a full <em>turn</em> in the <em>dark</em>.</p>
<p>It is not possible to read in the <em>dim</em> or <em>dark</em> with <em>infravision</em>. </p>
<h2>Bad</h2>
<p><em>Bad</em> is a generalized status conditions. </p>
<p><em>Attacks</em> and <em>stealth</em> against <em>bad</em> targets always succeed. </p>
<p><em>Bad</em> creatures can:
- Hear.
- Speak.
- <em>Save</em>.
- Desperate actions allowed by <em>badness</em>. For example, move randomly in the dark, or move inches while bound.  </p>
<p><em>Bad</em> cretures can not:
- Move.
- <em>Attack</em>.
- Cast spells.
- Use magic items.
- Use class skills.</p></body></html>
