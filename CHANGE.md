## From version 1.x to version 2.x

Changes fall into four broad catagories:

1. Making the game simpler and easier to run, play, and write.
2. Giving playes more agency.
3. Making the early game more forgiving and transperent. 
4. Correcting mistakes (e.g. dismemberment getting worse with higher con)

These are the most significant changes.
