	<h1>Yabec</h1>
	<p>Yet Another Basic/Expert Clone is a open source game system. It's designed as an alternative to other rule sets for the dragon game.</p>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>If you are familiar with B/X, OSE, or other OSR games, you are already largely familiar with Yabec. The differences you'll want to pay attention to are the overland travel, which is done as a point crawl. There are new classes, and the classic classes have some minor tweaks. The exact wording of the spells is different, but the selection is similar.</p>
