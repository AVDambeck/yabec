	<h1>Yabec</h1>
	<p>Yet Another Basic/Expert Clone is a open source game system. It's designed as an alternative to other rule sets for the dragon game.</p>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>If you are familiar with B/X, OSE, or other OSR games, you are already largely familiar with Yabec. The differences you'll want to pay attention to are the class options which are more modern feeling, and overland travel which is done as a point crawl. Yabec tries to put die rolls in front of the players.</p>

<h1>Basic Player Manual</h1>
<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p>Yabec is a Table Top Role Playing Game, where you take on the role of an adventurer in a fantasy world. You and a group of other traveliers explore a dangerous hole in the ground, in search of treasure.</p>
<p>One person takes on the role of Dungeon Master. They are a referee and guide. They'll describe a sichuation. Then you'll get to ask questions and gain more information. The Dungeon Master will narrate the consequences of your actions, or ask you to make dice rolls.</p>
<p>This is a classic dragon game, that's simlar to many of the fantasy role playing games which have achieved pop culture success. But, due to a lot of reasons, we dont associate with the megacorp product anymore.</p>

<h1>Alignment</h1>
<p>Beneath the surface of everyday life, two primeval forces mingle. Their servants favor either the cosmic order, or the advent of a new one. Some find themselves neutrally or unaligned, choosing for their own ends, or for the end of balance. </p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>Magic affects creatures differently depending on alignment. Divine spellcastes need to be especially aware of their alignment.</p>
<h2>Alignment Language</h2>
<p>Creatures automatically recognize a certain set of gestures, signs, and code words, pertaining to their alignment. This allows creatures of common alignment a measure of communication.</p>
<p>Creatures of a different alignment are likely to recognize an alignment language being spoken, but will not understand its content.</p>
<h2>Revealing Alignment</h2>
<p>Players must reveal their alignment to the dungeon master, but are not required to reveal to each other. </p>
<h2>Role Playing Alignment</h2>
<p>If the character acts too far out of their alignment, the referee may require them to change their alignment and suffer a penalty.</p>

	<h2>Turn Undead</h2>
	<p>Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters. To turn the undead, roll 2d6. The Dungeon Master can either tell you the HD of the monster, or consults the table themselves.</p>
	<p>If the result is equal to or greater than the number in the table, the monster is turned. At higher levels, some undead may be automatically <strong>T</strong>urned, or <strong>D</strong>estroyed.</p>
	<h3>Restrictions</h3>
	<p><strong>Excess:</strong> Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are wasted.</p>
	<p><strong>Minimum effect:</strong> At least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.</p>
	<p><strong>Mixed groups:</strong> If the undead are of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.</p>
	<p><strong>Recharge:</strong> A cleric can attempt to turn only once per <em>turn</em>.</p>

	<li>Refusal to buy, sell, or use poisons, including alcohol. </li>
	<li>10% tithe to the temple.</li>
	<li>Respect of all royalty. </li>
	</ul>

		<p>Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers (5d6 × 10 fighters of level 1–2). These troops are completely devoted to the cleric, having a loyalty of 12. The referee decides which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.</p>

	<h2>Thieves Cant</h2>
	<p>Thieves know a general code of conduct, including unique gestures, signs, and code words. This language allows them to communicate, while sounding like innocent small talk to the unfamiliar. </p>
	<h2>Thief Skills</h2>
	<p>Thieves are highly talented, and capable of many skills. See the skill progression table opposite.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Climb sheer surfaces (CS):</strong> A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway point, suffering fall damage. (1d6 per 10’)</li>
		<li><strong>Check Doors (CD):</strong> A thief gets a bonus to check doors See Adventure, page 9.</li>
		<li><strong>Open locks (OL):</strong> Requires thieves’ tools. A thief can only try this skill once per lock. If the roll fails, the thief may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.</li>
		<li><strong>Uncanny Stealth (US):</strong> A thief can attempt to hide motionless in shadows, or sneak past enemies unnoticed.</li>
		<li><strong>Pick pockets (PP):</strong> If the victim is above 5th level, the thief’s roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th. There is always at least a 1% chance of failure. A roll of more than twice the percentage is required for the theft to be unnoticed.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>Checking skills with a percent chance: roll d%. If it is the listed value or less, the skill succeeds. </p>

	<h3>Back-Stab</h3>
	<p>When attacking a <em>bad</em> opponet, a Thief deals double damage. Thievs of 6th level or higher deal triple damage.</p>
	<h2>Read Languages</h2>
	<p>A thief of 4th level or higher can decipher critical portions of non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular text again before gaining an experience level.</p>
	<h3>Scroll Use</h3>
	<p>A thief of 10th level or higher can cast arcane spells from scrolls. There is a 10% chance of error: the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual or deleterious effect.</p>
	<h2>After Reaching 9th Level</h2>
	<p>A thief can establish a thief den, attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. These thieves will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the PC will not be able to attract apprentices to replace them. A successful thief might use these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Climb sheer surfaces (CS):</b> A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the acrobat falls at the halfway point, suffering fall damage. (1d6 per 10’)</li>
<li><b>Falling (FA):</b> When able to tumble, suffer no damage from the first 10’ of any fall. Further damage is reduced by the listed percentage.</li>
<li><b>Catch Missiles (CM):</b> Once per turn, attempt to can catch a non-magical projectile. </li>
<li><b>Tightrope walking (TW):</b> Acrobats can walk tightropes, narrow beams, and ledges. Failure indicates that the acrobat falls. A balance pole increases the chance by 10%.</li>
<li><b>Evasion:</b> When you succeed a <em>saving throw</em>, take no damage instead of half. Take half damage instead of full on a failed save.</li>
<li><b>Nimble:</b> During <em>combat</em>, <em>attack</em> and <em>move</em> in one <em>action</em>.</li>
<li><b>Running Vault (RV):</b> With a 20’ run-up and a pole, jump this long, and half as high. </li>
<li><b>Quick movement (QM):</b> During <em>combat</em>, <em>move</em> two <em>zones</em>. Use a limited number of times per <em>turn</em>.</li>

<h2>Identification</h2>
<p>Druids can identify plants, animals and clean water.</p>
<h2>Shape Change</h2>
<p>At 2nd level, a druid gains the ability to change into animals. </p>
<h3>Shapes Known</h3>
<p>A druid can know as many shapes as their level. Learning a knew shape requires three observations, which must be on unique individuals, and on separate days. </p>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>Observation takes one turn and requires the druid to be unnoticed. </p>
<h3>Transforming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can only be used once per day.</li>
<li>Lasts a number of turns equal to the druid’s level. </li>
<li>Follows the same rules as spell casting. </li>
<li>Must be holding the bone or hide of the animal. </li>
<li>The animal must have hit dice equal to or less than the druid’s level. </li>
<li>If a druid has lost hit points, they regain 1d4 hit points per level upon changing into an animal. </li>
<li>All equipment carried by the druid is absorbed into the animal form and reappears when the druid changes back.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nature’s Favor</h2>
<p>Due to their ability to forage, druids do not need to consume rations when <em>traveling</em>.</p>
<h2>Pass Without Trace</h2>
<p>From 3rd level, a druid can pass through natural environments without leaving any tracks. A druid is also able to move through overgrown areas at normal speed and without impediment</p>
<h2>Charm Immunity</h2>
<p>Druids of 7th level and above are immune to charms.</p>
<h2>Reaching 12th Level and Above</h2>
<p>There can only be nine druids of 12th level. When a druid has enough experience to reach 12th level, they must challenge an existing 12th level druid. The character only advances to 12th level if the other druid is defeated. Such challenges may take any form that is agreed by both parties, including combat (which need not be fatal). Likewise, there can only be three druids of 13th level and a single druid (known as the arch-druid) of 14th level.</p>
<p>Druids who attain 12th level or above may have a bhold magically integrated into a natural setting.  </p>
<p>2d12 beings will join the ranger as followers. The nature of these followers is up to the referee.</p>

<h2>Detect Construction</h2>
<p>When searching, dwarves also detect new construction, sliding walls, sloping passages and other stone architectural features. See Error: Reference source not found, page 8.</p>
<h2>Infravision</h2>
<p>Dwarves have infravision. See Global p10.</p>
<h2>Tough</h2>
<p>Dwarves dismember with a advantage. See Global, page 20.</p>
<h2>Berserker</h2>
<p>While a dwarf has damage equal to or greater than 50% of their health, their AV is reduced by 4.</p>
<h2>After Reaching 9th Level</h2>
<p>A dwarf has the option of creating an underground bhold that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character’s clan will be attracted to live under their roof. Dwarves from other clans will generally be friendly and clans may collaborate in times of war or disaster.</p>
<p>A dwarf ruler may only hire dwarven mercenaries. However specialists and hirelings of any race may be hired. </p>

	<h2>creating magic Items</h2>
	<p>Only magic-users of 9th level or higher can create magic items. </p>
	<p>The player describes in detail the item that they wish. The Dungeon Master decides whether this is possible and, if so, what materials are required.</p>
	<h3>Restrictions</h3>
	<p>Divine spell casters May only create items that they are able to use themselves. Arcane spell casters may create any item except those that may only be used by divine spell casters.</p>
	<h3>Materials</h3>
	<p>Creating magic items requires rare components such as expensive gems or ingredients from rare monsters. </p>
	<h3>Cost and Time</h3>
	<p>If duplicating the effects of a spell, construction costs one week and 5g, per level of the mimicked spell, multiplied by the number of uses.</p>
	<p>The Dungeon Master must use discretion for other items. As a general rule, items should cost from 100 to 1000gp and from 4 to 52  weeks to complete. </p>
	<h2>Crime</h2>

	<h1>The Rule Book</h1>
	<p>The rule book is a point by point breakdown of all the game procedures. Players should familiarize themselves with the procedures for <a href="scheme/travel.html">travel</a>, <a href="scheme/explore.html">exploration</a>, and <a href="scheme/combat.html">combat</a>.
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The dungeon game is a game about finding treasure. We play as small armies of wizards, clerics, and thieves, who campaign through dangerous caves, seeking treasure guarded by monsters, traps, and curses. Doing so requires collaborating on creative solutions to impossible problems.</p>
	<h2>The Conversation</h2>
	<p>You may be familiar with this concept from other TTRPGs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the dungeon master. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>The dungeon master begins by describing a situation. </li>
		<li>Players discuss and ask questions. </li>
		<li>Eventually, the players choose to undertake some action.</li>
		<li>The dungeon master will describe the consequences of the action, sometimes utilizing dice.</li>
		<li>This becomes the new situation, and the loop begins again.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Schemes</h2>
	<p>You can think of a <em>scheme</em> as a sub-game, or as a phase the conversation goes through.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="scheme/town.html">Town</a>: Prepare for adventure, make characters, and buy supplies.</li>
		<li><a href="scheme/travel.html">Travel></a>: Travel a small overworld to a dungeon.</li>
		<li><a href="scheme/explore.html">Explore</a>: Delve into a dungeon, in search of treasure.</li>
		<li><a href="scheme/combat.html">Combat</a>: Fight your way out if you have to.</li>
		<li><a href="scheme/challenge.html">Challenge</a>: Overcome a large obstacle by succeeding many checks.</li>
		<li><a href="scheme/cleanup.html">Clean Up</a>: End the session by handle experience, splitting treasure, hosting funerals, and other loose ends.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Systems</h2>
	<p>Italics indicate a keyword within the rules. Systems are collections of mechanics that aren't isolated to a specific scheme.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="system/bad.html">bad</a>: A generalized status condition.</li>
		<li><a href="system/distance.html">distance</a>: Each room is a <em>zones</em>.</li>

	<h1>Combat</h1>
	<h2>First Round</h2>
	<p>During the first <em>round</em>, if one side is surprised, they are <em>bad</em> and don't act that round.</p>

	<h2>Initiative</h2>
	<p>At the start of each <em>round</em>, the dungeon master and the player each roll a d6. Whoever rolls higher goes first.</p>
	<h3>Dramatic Initiative</h3>
	<p>On occasion, the dungeon master might opt for this alternate method.</p>
	<p>Players can choose to go in any order they wish. However, after each player <em>actions</em>, an enemy of the dungeon master's choice will <em>act</em>. </p>
	<p>Each <em>round</em>, each combatant can take one <em>action</em>. Then they must wait for the next <em>round</em> to <em>act</em> again.</p>

	<h2>Actions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Move:</strong> Move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>. </li>
		<li><strong>Attack:</strong> Make an <em>attack</em> with a weapon. See below. You can also <em>move</em> before or after.</li>
		<li><strong>Magic:</strong> Cast a spell or use a magic item. See Magic. You must not have taken damage this <em>round</em> in order to cast a spell.</li>
		<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Until the end of the next <em>round</em>, you have <em>advantage</em> on <em>dodges</em>, <em>saves</em>, <em>attacks</em>, and <em>checks</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Sprint:</strong> <em>Move</em> twice. Make a <em>constitution check</em>. Make this check with advantage if you are not wearing armor made of metal. If you fail, you are <em>bad</em> during the next <em>round</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Stunts:</strong> Other maneuvers are stunts. See below. </li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Stunts</h2>
	<p>the idea of <em>stunts</em> encompasses grappling, tripping, and any other kind of creative option. <em>Stunts</em> may not cause damage directly, but can do about anything else.</p>
	<p>How <em>stunts</em> are resolved is up to the dungeon master. These are provided as examples.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Shove:</strong> a <em>hit</em> has a 3-in-6 chance of moving an enemy to an adjacent <em>zone</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Intimidation:</strong> with a successful <em>charisma check</em>, force enemies to make a <em>moral check</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Disarm:</strong> a <em>hit</em> grants a <em>dexterity check</em> to disarm an enemy.</li> 
		<li><strong>Sunder:</strong> a <em>hit</em> deals one damage to the weapon or armor.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Attacking</h2>
	<h3>Statistics</h3>
	<p>The Armor Class (AC) is how likely a target is to be hit. </p>
	<p>The Attack Value (AV), also called THAC0, is how likely an attack is to miss.</p>
	<p>Lower AC and AV are better.</p>
	<p>The Dungeon Master might either announce the result of the <em>attack</em>, or tell you the AC/AV so you can announce it yourself.</p>
	<h3>Making an Attack</h3>
	<p>To <em>attack</em>, subtract a d20 from your AV. If it is less than or equal to the AC, you <em>hit</em>. Otherwise, you <em>miss</em>.</p>
	<p><em>Melee attacks</em> have a range of <em>touch</em>. <em>ranged attacks</em> have a range <em>distant</em> (i.e. in adjacent <em>zones</em> or closer).</p>
	<h3>Dodging an Attack</h3>
	<p>To dodge an attack, roll a d20 and add your AC. If it is less than or equal to the AV, the attack is a <em>miss</em>. Otherwise, it is a <em>hit</em></p>
	
	<h2>Exhaustion</h2>
	<p>At the end of the 9th <em>round</em>, and each <em>round</em> after, all creatures still involved in the <em>combat</em> take 1 damage.</p>

	<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
	<h3>Flanking</h3>
	<p>In melee, if one side surrounds the other, the surrounded side has a +4 penalty to AC. </p>
	<h3>Friendly Fire</h3>
	<p>When a ranged attack <em>misses</em>, players make a <em>dexterity check</em> to void hitting an ally. Monsters and minons have a 3-in-6 chance.</p>
	<h3>Mapping</h3>
	<p>During conflict, it's possible to reference a map, but adding to a map is impossible. The dungeon master will not make <em>map calls</em>. See page X</p>
	<h3>Subdual</h3>
	<p>If a creature is <em>slain</em> with a blunt weapon, they can be left non-leathally incapacitated, and <em>bad</em> until a <em>shift</em>.</p>

	<h1>Travel</h1>
	<p>Significant locations are represented by <em>points</em>. Routes between them are represented by <em>paths</em>. 
	<h2>Paths</h2>
	<p>You can move from one <em>point</em> to the next by paying a cost. There are three types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Safe Path</em>: This path cost 1 ration per person to travel.</li>
		<li><em>Risky Path</em>: This path costs 1 ration per person to travel, and has a chance of random encounter.</li>
		<li><em>Toll Path</em>: This path has a price in silver to travel.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Points</h2>
	<p>There are three types of <em>point</em>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Soft</em>: Small feature which may be <em>explored</em>, e.g. an entrance to a cave.</li>
		<li><em>Hard</em>: Feature which must be <em>explored</em> e.g. a narrow pass in a mountain range.</li>
		<li><em>Civ</em>: Option to either <em>town</em>, <em>clean up</em>, or (so long as you aren't notorious) pass by.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Foraging</h2>
	<p>At any time the party may choose to <em>forage</em>: each character rolls a d6. On a 5, they find one ration. On a 6, the find two. On a 1-4, they take 1d6 damage.</p>
	<p>In dangerous areas, you might have to <em>forage</em> with <em>disadvantage</em>.</p>

<body>
	<h1>Negotiation</h1>
	<h2>When to Negotiate</h2>
	<p>Negotiation does not change an NPC's character. Instead, players convince an NPC that a certain course of action, is actually in character.<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Plausible request. Players need to write this down.</li>
		<li>NPC has reason not to immediately support the players.</li>
		<li>NPC wants to negotiate.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Statistics</h2>
	<p>The NPC has four stats: <em>interest</em>, <em>patience</em>, <em>motivation</em>, and <em>pitfall</em>.
	<h3>Interest</h3>
	<p><em>Interest</em> ranges from 0 to 5.</p>
	<p>If <em>interest</em> reaches 5, the NPC makes an <em>offer</em>.</p> 
	<p>If <em>interest</em> reaches 0, the NPC ends the <em>negotiation</em> without an <em>offer</em>.</p> 
	<h3>Patience</h3>
	<p>Patience ranges from 0 to 5, and can only be reduced. When patience reaches 0, the NPC makes a final <em>offer</em>.</p>
	<h3>Starting Stats</h3>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Attitude</th>
			<th>Interest</th>
			<th>Patience</th>

		<tr>
			<td>Hostile</td>
			<td>1</td>

		<tr>
			<td>Friendly</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>4</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<h3>Motivation and Pitfall</h3>
	<p>When an <em>argument</em> <em>appeals</em> to a <em>motivation</em> without mentioning a <em>pitfall</em>, the result gets better. When it <em>appeals</em> to a <em>pitfall</em>, it gets worse.</p>
	<p>Each NPC will have about three <em>motivations</em> and about two <em>pitfalls</em>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Benevolence</li>
		<li>Discovery</li>
		<li>Freedom</li>
		<li>Greed</li>
		<li>Higher Authority</li>
		<li>Justice</li>
		<li>Legacy</li>
		<li>Peace</li>
		<li>Power</li>
		<li>Protection</li>
		<li>Revelry</li>
		<li>Vengeance</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Discovering Motivation (and Pitfalls)</h2>
	<p>A player can attempt a <em>wisdom</em> or <em>intelligence</em> <em>check</em> to check a particular <em>motivation</em>. If they <em>succeed</em>, the dungeon master will confirm whether it is a <em>motivation</em>, <em>pitfall</em>, or neither. However, if they <em>fail</em>, reduce <em>patience</em> by one.</p>
	<p>Once the players make this <em>check</em>, they can not do so again until they make an <em>argument</em></p>
	<h3>Other Methods</h3>
	<p>An NPC with <em>interest</em> 3 or more may hint at their <em>motivations</em> if asked.</p>
	<p>Outside of <em>negotiation</em> can interrogate close friends, or otherwise preform recognisance.</p>
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>Players must make a full argument the NPC; that is, what the NPC should do, and why.</p>
	<p>The dungeon master will determine if this appealed to any <em>motivations</em> or <em>pitfalls</em>. </p>
	<p>If it appeals to a <em>pitfall</em>, the NPC looses one <em>patience</em> AND one <em>interest</em>.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, one player will make a wisdom or charisma check. Compare the result on the table.</p>

	<h1>Clean Up</h1>
	<h2>Divide treasure</h2>
	<p>The <em>quarter master</em> totals the value of the treasure, and splits it between the players.</em>
	<p>Money is typically split evenly, while magic items can be diced or bargained for.</p>
	<h2>Award Experience</h2>
	<p>The <em>score keeper</em> confers with the dungeon master to confirm each of the <em>scores</em> and their value. Then totals it and divides it by the surviving players.</p>

	<h1>Town</h1>
	<p>The game often starts slowly as people gather, are late, loose character sheets, etc. Town is this pedantic meander towards playing the real game. To officiate the process, here is the check list:</p>
	<h2>Checklist</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Everyone has a character sheet.</li>
		<li>Returning characters heal completely, and do downtime</li>
		<li>Make sure the party has torches, rations, and other essentials</li>
		<li>Hire minions (if 2nd level)</li>
	</ul>
	<p> When everything is in order, begin <em>travel</em></p>

	<h2>Shopping</h2>
	<p>Every town will have the <em>basic</em> items available. Some towns may have additional shops. Ask your Dungeon Master.</p>

	<h2>Minions</h2>
	<p>If there is a character of 2nd level or greater, 1d4 human hirelings will seek employment. If the total level of the party is 15 or greater, 2d6 2nd level hirelings will seek employment.</p>

	<h2>Downtime</h2>
	<p>The first time in <em>town</em> per session, returning characters get one <em>downtime</em>. See .....</p>
	<p>Characters who owe <em>service</em> must preform it before pursing other options.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Each session, the players may agree to set one goal for the party. If the goal has already been completed in the past, or is not difficult enough, the Dungeon Master may reject it.</p>
	<p>Completing a goal is a <em>score</em>. See Experience.</p>
	<h3>Examples</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Kill the bear with the scarred eye.</li>
		<li>Get to the third level of the dungeon.</li>
		<li>Rescue a particular prisoner.</li>
		<li>Recover a particular treasure.</li>

	<h1>Challenge</h1>
	<h2>Objective</h2>
	<p>At the start of a <em>challenge</em>, the dungeon master will announce the number of <em>successes</em> needed to complete the <em>challenge.</em> as well as the number of <em>failures</em> to fail the challenge.</p>
	<h2>Procedure</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Players make action to confront the <em>challenge</em>, and how they will support each other.</li>
		<li>Dungeon master will say which <em>ability</em> to use, and if it is <em>risky.</em></li>
		<li>The player makes the <em>check</em>, with <em>advantage</em> for each supporter. </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Risky</h2>
	<p><em>Risky</em> checks start with two <em>disadvantages</em>, and results in either two <em>failures</em> or two <em>successes</em>.</p>
</body>

<body>
	<h1>Exploration</h1>
	<p>This is the main scheme, and where you should expect to spend most of your time</p>
	<h2>Procedure</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Listen</li>
		<li>Open door</li>
		<li>Encounter</li>
		<li>Mapping</li>
		<li>Searching (optional)</li>
		<li>Repeat</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Listening</h2>
	<p><em>Listening</em> at a door or corridor can reveal what lies beyond. Roll a d6, and add the bonus from your <em>wisdom</em> score (Some classes, like thieves, have additional bonuses). On a result of six or more, the dungeon master will reveal sounds you are able to hear.</p>
	<h2>Opening Doors</h2>
	<p>When opening a door, <em>check</em> your <em>strength</em>. If you fail, the door makes a <em>loud</em> sound. Otherwise, the door opens <em>silently</em>.
	<p>Only a player at the <em>front</em> of the marching order can open doors; opening a door implies moving to the <em>front</em>.
	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a <em>shift</em>.</p>
	<p>Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. </p>
	<p>Physically destroying a door is an <em>action</em>, requires appropriate tools, and makes <em>loud</em> noise. </p>
<h2>basics</h2>
	<h2>Movement</h2>
	<h3>Marching Order</h3>
	<p>While moving through narrow doors and halls, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the <em>front</em> and the <em>back</em> are significant. </p>
	<h3>Distance</h3>
	<p>If nothing else ends the <em>turn</em>, moving through three <em>zones</em> (i.e. three rooms), is a <em>turn</em> (see below). By moving quickly through a familiar area, you can move up to nine <em>zones</em> instead.
	<h2>Encounters</h2>
	<h3>Surprise</h3>
	<p>When the players enter a room while <em>hidden</em>, they <em>surprise</em> any monsters in the room, and have an advantage.</p> 
	<h3>Reaction</h3>
	<p>The dungeon master might ask for a <em>reaction modifier</em> to determine the monsters reaction. Use the highest modifier among players in the <em>front</em>.
	<h3>Decision to Evade</h3>
	<p>When two groups encounter one another, one or both may decide to evade the other, or one group may decide to purse the evading group.</p>
	<p>If both choose to evade, nothing happens.</p>
	<p>If one chooses to evade, and is not pursed, nothing happens.</p>
	<p>If one chooses to evade, and is pursed, the chance of successfully evading is 3-in-6. If they fail, begin <em>combat</em></p>
	<p>If one group is hidden from the other and chooses to evade, they succeed automatically, and without alerting them.</p>
	<p>If one group is surprised, they are unable to evade.</p>

	<h3>Mapping</h3>
	<p>Once the encounter (if any) is settled, players are able to observe the room for long enough to add to their <a href="mapping.html">map</a>.</p>
	<h3>Searching</h3>
	<p>Very little treasure will be obvious at first glance. <em>Searching</em>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reveals all non-obvious features, such as traps.</li>
		<li>Will always reveal everything it can.</li>
		<li>Takes a minimum of three people per <em>zone</em>.</li>
		<li>Is a <em>turn</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Checking a single location (such as a chest or body) can be done without a full <em>search</em>.</p>
	<h3>Rest</h3>
	<p>Taking a <em>turn</em> to <em>rest</em> removes <em>fatigue</em>. Ignore the <em>fatigue hazard</em> while <em>resting</em>.</p>

	<h2>Turns</h2>
	<p>A <em>turn</em> represents roughly 10 minutes of game time. Each <em>turn</em>, the dungeon master will check for <em>hazards</em>.</p>
	<p>A <em>combat</em>, <em>resting</em>, and <em>searching</em> take a <em>turn</em>. Depending on how complex, a disarming a trap or solving a puzzle may be a <em>turn</em>. A particularly long conversation may be a <em>turn</em>. Walking for a long enough period is a <em>turn</em> (see above).</p>
	<h3>Hazards</h3>
	<p>Different environments will have different odds, but generally, there's 1-in-6 chance of each hazard. Some areas may have more or less wandering monsters, some areas may have additional <em>hazards</em>, etc.</p>
	<p>The dungeon master should knock on the table to indicate the <em>hazard</em>.</p>
	<h3>Burn</h3>
	<p>Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.</p>
	<h3>Fatigue</h3>
	<p>Become <em>fatigued</em>. Anyone already <em>fatigued</em> takes 1d4 damage. </p>
	<h3>Shift</h3>
	<p>Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.</p>
	<h3>Wandering Monsters</h3>
	<p>In dangerous or unstable areas, monsters may begin hunting you.</p>

	<h2>Fleeing the Dungeon</h2>
	<p>once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. </p>
	<p>each <em>round</em>, move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>. Then one character must take 1d4 damage. </p>

		<h1>Mapping</h1>
	<p>Dungeons are complex environments where it is easy to get lost. Keeping a map is essential. Its recommended that one player take on the role of Mapper. See Roles.</p>
	<p> GFC's video "SPEEDY DUNGEON MAPS in D&D! GIT GUD at CALLING YOUR MAPS!" is a perfect explanation of dungeon mapping. 
	<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prijsOI3xWs</p>
	<p>A text version of this system is available on the web version of Yabec.</p>
	<h2>Simple Method</h2>
	<p>Rather than track the exact dimensions of every room, the mapper might opt to keep a general shape of the dungeon.</p>
	<p>The mapper draws a loose flow chart, labeling rooms and their connections.</p>

	<h1>Bad</h1>
	<p><em>Bad</em> is a monolithic, generalized status conditions. </p>
	<p><em>Attacks</em> against <em>bad</em> targets always succeed. </p>
	<p><em>Bad</em> creatures can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hear. </li>
		<li>Speak. </li>
		<li><em>Save</em>. </li>
		<li>Take desperate actions: For example, move randomly in the dark, or move inches while bound.  </li>
	</ol>
	<p><em>Bad</em> creatures can not:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Move. </li>
		<li><em>Attack</em>.</li>
		<li>Cast spells.</li>
		<li>Use magic items.</li>
		<li>Use class skills.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Depending on the exact condition, <em>Bad</em> creatures might be able to take some limited action. For example, a blind creature may be able to move randomly, or a bound character might work to break out of their restraints.</p>

	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<p>This chapter covers experience points (XP) and how it is awarded. XP is a measure of a PC's power and wealth, and creates progression.</p>
	<h2>Score Card</h2>
	<p>At the start of the session, the <em>Score Keeper</em> will begin a score card: a simple piece of paper to write down <em>scores</em> as they happen.</p>
	<p>At the end of the session, the <em>Score Keeper</em> will confer with the dungeon master to confirm each <em>score</em>, and establish the total amount of XP. </p>
	<p>XP is divided evenly between all surviving characters. The <em>Score Keeper</em> will announce the individual amount gained.</p>
	<h3>Minions</h3>
	<p>If a player is 2nd level or higher, their minions gain the same amount of XP. </p>
	<h3>Variant Rule: Prime Requisite</h3>
	<p>Each class has one or two prime requisites, which grants bonus XP for having a high <em>ability score</em>.</p>
	<p>Characters with at least a 9 in one prime requisite gain 5% extra XP. </p>
	<p>Characters with at least a 9 in both gain 15% extra XP.</p>
	<p>Characters with at least a 16 in one prime requisite gain 15% extra XP.</p>
	<h2>Scores</h2>
	<p>A <em>score</em> is anything that awards XP.</p>
	<h3>Treasure</h3>
	<p>Recovering treasure from a dungeon <em>scores</em> 1 XP per 1 cp value of the treasure.</p>
	<p>Recovering a magic item <em>scores</em> 1000 XP.</p>
	<h3>Optional: Defeated Monster</h3>
	<p>Defeating monsters <em>scores</em> XP based on their HD, plus a bonus for each special ability. E.g. a 2 HD monster with an ability is worth 25 XP.</p>

	<h3>Optional: Challenge</h3>
	<p>Completing a challenge scores 100 XP times the number of <em>successes</em>.</p>
	<h3>Roles</h3>
	<p>Having players with <em>roles</em> during <em>clean up</em> <em>scores</em> 25 XP for each unique role. Duplicate roles <em>score</em> 10 xp.  </p>
	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>Achieving a <em>goal</em> <em>scores</em> 100 XP per character involved. </p>
	<p>Failing to achieve a <em>goal</em> <em>scores</em> -300 XP.</p>
	<h3>Mapping</h3>
	<p>Exactly mapping a complete dungeon level <em>scores</em> XP equal to 1000 times the depth of the level.</p>
	
	<h2>Extra Sources of XP</h2>
	<h3>Taking a role in town</h3>
	<p>Taking on a <em>role</em> in town can score immediately XP.</p>
	<h3>Session Report</h3>
	<p>Writing a session report scores 100 XP to the writer at the start of the next session. </p>
	
	<h2>Leveling Up</h2>
	<p>When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Looks at your class progression tables and notes any improvements in saves, AV, spells, etc. </li>
		<li>Roll your HD and add it to your HP.</li>
		<li>Gain an additional <em>downtime</em>. </li>
		<li>At levels 3, 6, 9, 12, and 14, Increase two different <em>ability scores</em> by 1, to a maximum of 18. At 9th and 14th level, you may instead increase one <em>ability</em> with an 18 to a 20.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>One Session Maximum</h3>
	<p>Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Leave the character 1 XP below the threshold for the next level. The remaining XP can be distributed among the other characters, as the player wishes. If all characters are 1 XP below the threshold, extra XP is wasted.</p>
	
	<h2>Abandonment</h2>
	<p>A character of 2nd level or higher can be abandoned. They permanently leave the game. Abandoned characters can leave 50% of their wealth and 80% of their XP to a new character.</p>

	<h1>Light</h1>
	<h2>Levels</h2>
	<p>There are three kinds of light:</p>
	<h3>Dark</h3>
	<p>The <em>darkness</em> is pitch black, and prevents sight. Impasses blindness.</p>
	<h3>Dim</h3>
	<p>Allows some detail to be seen.</p>
	<h3>Bright</h3>
	<p>Allows full vision, including details and reading. Disables <em>infravision</em>.</p>
	<h2>Distance</h2>
	<p>A light source casts <em>bright</em> light within <em>touch</em>, and <em>dim</em> within <em>distant</em>. </p>

	<h2>Infravision</h2>
	<p>A special type of vision had by many monsters: seeing heat energy that radiates of living things. </p>
	<p>When a creature with <em>infravision</em> stands in <em>bright</em>, they are blinded for one round, and their <em>infravision</em> is disabled until they spend a full <em>turn</em> in the <em>dark</em>.</p>
	<p>It is not possible to read in the <em>dim</em> or <em>dark</em> with <em>infravision</em>. </p>
	<h2>Blindness</h2>
<p>Creatures who are unable to perceive their surroundings are <em>bad</em>.</p></body></html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
	<h1>Distance</h1>
	<h2>Zones</h2>
	<p>The dungeon environment is split into <em>zones</em>. As a rule of thumb, each room and hallway is a <em>zone</em>. Large rooms or hallways may be multipole <em>zones</em>. </p>
	<h3>Guidelines</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Architectural features, such as doorways, should divide <em>zones</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>40':</strong> Rooms bigger than 40', and hallways longer than 40', should be multiple <em>zones</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Even:</strong> Large rooms and hallways should have their <em>zones</em> divided evenly. </li>
		<li><strong>Whole Number:</strong> Large rooms and hallways should always have a whole number of <em>zones</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Ranges</h2>
	<p>Ranges and relative location are divided into four <em>ranges</em>.</p>
	<h3>Touch</h3>
	<p>Striking distance. </p>
	<h3>Close</h3>
	<p>Throwing distance. Speaking distance. With in the same <em>zone</em>.</p>
	<h3>Distant</h3>
	<p>Shouting distance. In adjacent <em>zones</em>. Farthest distance to make out details (in <em>bright</em> light). </p>
	<p>In dark environments, the player's torch will often be the limit of their sight. This means that anything within torch light is <em>distant.</em></p>
	<h3>Sight</h3>
	<p>Anything that can be seen. Up to 3 miles in ideal conditions.</p>

	<h1>Player Roles</h1>
	<p>Using <em>roles</em> makes play smoother and easier for the dungeon master.</p>
	<p>In addition to potentially being a <em>score</em> for the party, taking on a <em>role</em> during <em>town</em> scores awards 50 XP to that character. 100 XP for <em>callers</em> and <em>mappers</em>.</p>
	<p>Its possible to have multiple of most <em>roles</em>. For example, there can be a <em>caller</em> for exploration and a <em>caller</em> for combat, or two <em>mappers</em> that check each other's work.</p>
	<h2>Mapper</h2>
	<p>Keep track of the layout of the dungeon. If you'd like, ask the Dungeon Master for exact <em>map calls</em>. See mapping.</p>
	<h2>Caller</h2>
	<p>Get consensus on what the party would like to do, and communicate to the Dungeon Master.</p>
	<h2>Chair</h2>
	<p>Make sure that all the <em>roles</em> are filled.</p>
	<h2>Score Keeper</h2>
	<p>Keep track of <em>scores</em>, such as looted treasure, and defeated monsters. See experience.</p>
	<h2>Scribe</h2>
	<p>Keep track of the different monsters and traps, their behaviors, mechanics, and even their combat statistics (depending on the Dungeon Master's approach to metagaming).</p>
	<h2>Quarter Master</h2>
	<p>Keep track of torches, bandages, and other equipment. Keep track of loot as it collected.</p>

	<p>A character has a base of five <em>slots</em>, plus five from a backpack is ten, plus a bonus from their <em>constitution</em>.</p>
	<p>Chests and carts can be used to carry even more. Minions also have item <em>slots</em>, typically five.</p>
	<h3>Encumbrance</h3>
	<p>Becoming <em>encumbered</em> doubles a creature's <em>slots</em>.
	<em>Encumbered</em> creatures are <em>bad</em>, but can <em>attack</em> with disadvantage, and move at half speed.</p>

	<h1>Rolls</h1>
	<p>This page details a lot of different kinds of rolls.</p>
	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<p>There are six abilities: <em>strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom,</em> and <em>charisma</em>. They're rated from 3, the worst, to 18, the best.</p>
	<h3>Checking</h3>
	<p>You succeed if d20 &lt;= the ability score. (low roll good)</p>
	
	<h2>Saves</h2>
	<p>All characters and monsters can make <em>saves</em> to avoid the full effects of certain traps, spells, and attacks.</p>
	<p>Having a lower save value is better.</p>
	<h3>Categories:</h3>
	<p>There are five saving throw categories:
	- <strong>Death (D):</strong> When targeted by a death ray, or exposed to poison.
	- <strong>Weird (W):</strong> When exposed to radiation or other worlds.
	- <strong>Paralysis or Petrification (P):</strong> When targeted by an effect that paralyses or turns to stone.
	- <strong>Blast (B):</strong> When target by dragon breath or explosions.
	- <strong>Spells or magic (S)</strong> When targeted by a baneful spell or effect from a magic item. </p>
	<p>Your class's progression table determines you <em>save</em> values. </p>
	<h3>Checking</h3>
	<p>You succeed if d20 &gt;= <em>save</em> value. (high roll good)</p>
	<p>Success against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved. Otherwise, the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.</p>
	
	<h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
	<h3>Advantage</h3>
	<p>When making a roll with <em>advantage</em>, roll an additional time for each <em>advantage</em>. Take the best roll.</p>
	<h3>Disadvantage</h3>
	<p>When making a roll with <em>disadvantage</em>, roll twice and take the worse.</p>
	<h3>Combination.</h3>
	<p>One <em>disadvantage</em> and one <em>advantage</em> cancel out.</p>
	
	<h2>Variant Rule: Heroism</h2>
	<p>Push yourself. Take 2 damage or reduce you <em>constitution score</em> by one. Choose one:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gain <em>advantage</em> on one <em>check</em>.</li>
		<li>Take an action dispite <em>bad</em> with <em>disadvantage</em>.</li>

	<h1>Life and Death</h1>
	<p>This section covers health, damage, and dying.</p>
	<p>Unlike many games which count HP down, Yabec counts damage up. </p>
	<h2>Health Points</h2>
	<p>Health points (HP) represent the ability to withstand injury and exhaustion.</p>
	<h3>Health Die (HD)</h3>
	<p>Health dice are used to determine HP. Each class has a different HD. Monsters have a d8 HD.</p>
	<p>At 1st level, a character's HP is equal to the highest value on their HD.</p>

	<h2>Damage</h2>
	<p><em>Damage</em> represents injury, exhaustion, and wear. </p>
	<h3>Slain</h3>
	<p>When a creature takes <em>damage</em> equal to or greater tan its HP, it is <em>slain</em>,
	<em>Slain</em> minions and <em>ordinary</em> monsters instantly die. 
	<em>Slain</em> PCs and <em>powerful</em> monsters are <em>near death</em>. See below.</p>
	<h4>Destruction</h4>
	<p>If <em>slain</em> by fire, or explosion, items are destroyed, and PCs and <em>powerful</em> monsters instantly die. Magic items have a chance of miraculously surviving.</p>
	<h3>Item Damage</h3>
	<p>Some items can become <em>damaged</em>. Items with four or more <em>damage</em> break completely. Magic items are immune to <em>damage</em>.</p>
	<p>Each point of <em>damage</em> incurs a penalty:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Weapons:</b> -1 to damage rolls.</li>
	<li><b>Armor:</b> +1 to AC.</li>
	<li><b>Other:</b> -1 to any rolls made with it.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Dwarves are able to repair items as <em>downtime</em>. </p>

	<h2>Healing</h2>
	<p><em>Healing</em> removes <em>damage</em>.</p>
	<h3>Magical Healing</h3>
	<p>Magic potions or spells can provide instantaneous healing.</p>
	<p>When magically <em>healing</em> a <em>near death</em> character, they <em>dismember</em> with advantage.</p>
	<h3>Bandage</h3>
	<p>Bandages can be used to gain some healing. Make an <em>intelligence</em> check. If you succeed, <em>heal</em> the target 1d6, plus a bonus from your <em>wisdom</em>. See <em>ability scores</em>. You may bandage yourself.</p>
	<p>Bandaging consumes a bandage. Once you are bandaged, you can not be bandaged again until you are <em>damaged</em>.</p>

	<h2>After Death</h2>
	<h3>Burial</h3>
	<p>Simple burial prevents the body from being reanimated.</p>
	<p>Temples will bury and bless the dead for free.</p>
	<p>Cremation prevents reanimation and is impossible to undo.</p>
	<p>If a cleric uses one turn to preform a blessing, the soul will pass peacefully.</p>
	<h2>Funeral</h2>
	<p>When a character is buried in town, a funeral can be given. For each cp spent on the funeral, that player gains 1 XP. In addition, all players that attend the funeral gain XP equal to 10% of the total cp spent.</p>
	<p>The maximum total cp that can be spent is equal to the dying characters XP.</p>
	<p>When funerary rites are preformed, the character sheet must be ripped up. Players are encouraged to give eulogy, play music, and create intricate rituals.</p>
	<h3>Inheritance</h3>
	<p>Money and items stored in town will be subject to a 15% estate tax to local government or temple, and then inherited by the next of kin or listed heir.</p>
	<h3>Resurrection</h3>
	<p>Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two weeks of bed rest, they have 1 HP, move at half the normal rate, can not carry <em>heavy</em>  items, cannot attack, cast spells, or use class skills. </p>
<p>Each time a character is resurrected, their <em>constitution</em> is reduced by 1. </p></body></html>
	<h3>New Character</h3>
	<p>As soon as you have a new character sheet, they can join the adventure anytime the party is in <em>town</em>. </p>

	<h2>Low Ability Score</h2>
	<p>If a character has an ability score reduced to less than three, they die.</p>

	<h1>Appendix A - Additional Notes<h1>
	<h2>Modification</h2>
	<p>The book is meant to act as a standard reference for how the Dungeon Master makes rulings. While the Dungeon Master's call is ultimently final, its recommended to stick to the book, and later change unsatisfactory rules. Yabec is open source, and available on Github.</p>
	<p>If players don't like the rules, they should begin a conversation about how they would like the rule, and the kind of game they are interested in playing. When an agreement is made, it should be reflected in the book. If they have other games they are interested in playing, they should also bring those to the conversation. /gen</p>
	<p>The book also acts as a suggest stock of rulings. If the Dungeon Master should be able to appeal to the book, and get a simple but opinionated rule. The new rule should not disrupt the flow of play, but rather maintain it. If the rule turns unfun, it should be ammended via the above process.</p>
	<h2>Metagaming Comment</h2>
	<p>I have a lax approach to metagaming. Any info gained during the session is valid, including;</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Info from dead characters.</li>
	<li>Deduced AC and Hit Dice.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>What would be metagaming would be searching the internet for answers, or reading the adventure source books.</p>
	<p>This comment is meant to give the superflous mechanical permision to do this.</p>
