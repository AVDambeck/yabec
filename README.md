# Yabec
yet another basic/expert clone

Yabec started as a way to codify the Old School Rennessance mix I was running at my table. It now is an open source project for others to work from.

# Direction
Yabec is under construction! The rules and classes are largly finished. Work is mainly being put into 

1. Make everything pretty and legible.
2. Bring over missing content from Version 1 (namely the spells).

Tweaks here and there are happening to the exact language. In general, YABEC aims to be simple, modular, opinated but reasonable, and retro-compatible.

## Suggestions
I'm always open to suggestions. Here's a list of things I'm activly looking for suggestions on:

- Better names for bad.
- Disambiguate roles and rolls.
- Make website into pdf.

## Pivot to HTML
Html is easier to style than ODT (used for version 1.) Version 2.0 and 2.1 was built around a workflow from markdown, and used python. However, it became increasingly unyieldy. Version 2.3 will use only HTML, and maybe JavaScript (vomit). 

The main medium has switch to HTML. PDF will return later.

# Features
what kind of system is yabec? what can you expect?

- 4 basic classes, plus lots of extras
- b/x math
- hazard die
- relative distances and zones
- mapping guides
- player roles 
- object oriented hooks for bite sized rules
- Database solution for item and spell info (coming soon)

# Liscensing
I've always intended Yabec to be FOSS, I just haven't picked out a share-alike liscense yet. Ask me, or idk, its a git repo; i cant stop you.
