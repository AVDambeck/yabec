# yabec
yet another basic/expert clone

Yabec started as a way to codify the Old School Rennessance mix I was running at my table. It now is an open source project for others to work from.

# Jupyter
Yabec is under construction! I've been pushing the limits of what Libre Office can do. Right now, I'm working on moving towards using a jupyter notebook.

# Printing
Yabec is designed to exist at a physical game table in a bunch of little notebooks. Under the export dir, there are print files for each of these booklets. The system is also availbe as a single pdf, and as .odt file.
