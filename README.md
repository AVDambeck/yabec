# yabec
yet another basic/expert clone

Yabec started as a way to codify the Old School Rennessance mix I was running at my table. It now is an open source project for others to work from.

# direction
Yabec is under construction! I had been pushing the limits of what Libre Office can do. Right now, I'm working on moving towards a dynamic solution including databases, markdown, and css.

this has spawned a side project: (markuary book)[https://github.com/AVDambeck/markury-book]

Game data is stored either directly in markdown, or markdown is genorated via python. Then that markdown is converted to html, mixed with css, and rendered into a pdf for printing. 

There are three intended distribution points:
1. Raw markdown: intended for nerds.
2. Print, via pdf: to be used at game tables.
3. Hypertext: for web.

# Features
what kind of system is yabec? what can you expect?

- 4 basic classes, plus lots of extras
- Apocolypse style player sheets (coming soon)
- b/x math
- hazard die
- relative distances
- mapping guides
- player roles
- object oriented hooks for bite sized rules
- dynamically linked item and spell info

# Printing
Yabec is designed to exist at a physical game table in a bunch of little notebooks. Under the distribution dir, there are print files for each of these booklets.
