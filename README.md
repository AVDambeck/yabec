# yabec
yet another basic/expert clone

Yabec started as a way to codify the Old School Rennessance mix I was running at my table. It now is an open source project for others to work from.

# direction
Yabec is under construction! I've been pushing the limits of what Libre Office can do. Right now, I'm working on moving towards a dynamic solution including databases, markdown, and css.

Game data is stored either directly in markdown, or markdown is genorated via python. Then that markdown is converted to html, mixed with css, and rendered into a pdf for printing. 

There are three intended distribution points:
1. Raw markdown: intended for devs.
2. Print, via pdf: to be used at game tables.
3. Hypertext: for web.

# Printing
Yabec is designed to exist at a physical game table in a bunch of little notebooks. Under the distribution dir, there are print files for each of these booklets.
