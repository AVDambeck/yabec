	<h1>The Rule Book</h1>
	<p>The rule book is a point by point breakdown of all the game procedures. Players should familiarize themselves with the procedures for <a href="scheme/travel.html">Travel</a>, <a href="scheme/delve.html">Delve</a>, and <a href="scheme/conflict.html">Conflict</a>.
	<h2>The Conversation</h2>
	<p>You may be familitar with this concept from other ttrpgs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the Dungeon Master. </p>
	<ol>
	<li>The Dungeon Master begins by describing a sitchuation. </li>
	<li>Players ask questions to gain information about the enviornment. </li>
	<li>Eventually, the players choose to undertake some action. The Dungeon Master will describe the consequences of the action, sometimes taking specific die rolls into consideration. </li>
	<li>This becomes the new sitchuation, and the loop begins again.</li>
	</ol>
