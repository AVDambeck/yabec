	<h1>The Rule Book</h1>
	<p>The rule book is a point by point breakdown of all the game procedures. Players should familiarize themselves with the procedures for <a href="scheme/travel.html">travel</a>, <a href="scheme/explore.html">exploration</a>, and <a href="scheme/combat.html">combat</a>.
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The dungeon game is a game about finding treasure. We play as small armies of wizards, clerics, and thieves, who campaign through dangerous caves, seeking treasure guarded by monsters, traps, and curses. Doing so requires collaborating on creative solutions to impossible problems.</p>
	<h2>The Conversation</h2>
	<p>You may be familiar with this concept from other TTRPGs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the dungeon master. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>The dungeon master begins by describing a situation. </li>
		<li>Players discuss and ask questions. </li>
		<li>Eventually, the players choose to undertake some action.</li>
		<li>The dungeon master will describe the consequences of the action, sometimes utilizing dice.</li>
		<li>This becomes the new situation, and the loop begins again.</li>
	</ol>
