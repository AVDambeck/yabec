<h1>The Rule Book</h1>
<p>This section is a point by point breakdown of every aspect of the game system. It is not the player's requirement to read the player's reference. New players should use the <a href="/basic/index.html">Basic Players Manual</a> to create a character, and then learn by playing.</p>
<p>All players are welcome and encouraged to read the rule book in order to gain a better understanding of the game, but only at their leisure and interest.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master should know the rules well enough to run and teach them. </p>
<h2>Modification</h2>
<p>The book is meant to act as a standard reference for how the Dungeon Master makes rulings. While the Dungeon Master's call is ultimently final, its recommended to stick to the book, and later change unsatisfactory rules. Yabec is open source, and available on Github.</p>
<p>If players don't like the rules, they should begin a conversation about how they would like the rule, and the kind of game they are interested in playing. When an agreement is made, it should be reflected in the book. If they have other games they are interested in playing, they should also bring those to the conversation. /gen</p>
<p>The book also acts as a suggest stock of rulings. If the Dungeon Master should be able to appeal to the book, and get a simple but opinionated rule. The new rule should not disrupt the flow of play, but rather maintain it. If the rule turns unfun, it should be ammended via the above process.</p>

<h2>The Conversation</h2>
<p>You may be familitar with this concept from other ttrpgs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the Dungeon Master. </p>
<ol>
<li>The Dungeon Master begins by describing a sitchuation. </li>
<li>Players ask questions to gain information about the enviornment. </li>
<li>Eventually, the players choose to undertake some action. The Dungeon Master will describe the consequences of the action, sometimes taking specific die rolls into consideration. </li>
<li>This becomes the new sitchuation, and the loop begins again.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>Some actions are <em>actions</em>. The italics indicate that this is a <em>hook</em>, a keyword with in the rules, with specific consequences. </p>
<p>Yabec is designed around chains of <em>hooks</em>. For example, in <em>conflict</em>, the game is played in <em>rounds</em>, which during each you get one <em>action</em>, which you use to <em>attack</em>, and then when all <em>combatants</em> have acted, a new <em>round</em> begins, and so on...</p>
<h2>Schemes</h2>
<p>You can think of a <em>scheme</em> as a sub-game, or as a model to guide the conversation.</p>
<h3><a href="scheme/town.html">Town</a></h3>
<p>Players navigate an urban setting, often splitting up to do <em>downtime</em>, or go shopping. The <em>scheme</em> ends when the players <em>depart</em> on an <em>adventure</em>.</p>
<h3><a href="scheme/delve.html">Delve</a></h3>
<p>Players explore a dangerous dungeon. This <em>scheme</em> ends when the players leave the dungeon. Then <em>clean up</em>.</p>
<h3><a href="scheme/conflict.html">Conflict</a></h3>
<p>Players fight or flee from monsters. This <em>scheme</em> occers within a <em>delve</em>, or rarely, in a <em>town</em>.</p>
<h3><a href="scheme/challenge.html">Challenge</a></h3>
<p>Players race to get enought <em>successes</em>. This <em>scheme</em> is blended in with others.</p>
<h3><a href="scheme/cleanup.html">Clean Up</a></h3>
<p>Handle experience, splitting treasure, and other loose ends. Either end the session here, or begin <em>town</em> again.</p></body></html>
