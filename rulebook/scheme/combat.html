	<h1>Combat</h1>
	<h2>First Round</h2>
	<p>During the first <em>round</em>, if one side is surprised, they are <em>bad</em> and don't act that round.</p>

	<h2>Initiative</h2>
	<p>At the start of each <em>round</em>, the dungeon master and the player each roll a d6. Whoever rolls higher goes first.</p>
	<h3>Dramatic Initiative</h3>
	<p>On occasion, the dungeon master might opt for this alternate method.</p>
	<p>Players can choose to go in any order they wish. However, after each player <em>actions</em>, an enemy of the dungeon master's choice will <em>act</em>. </p>
	<p>Each <em>round</em>, each combatant can take one <em>action</em>. Then they must wait for the next <em>round</em> to <em>act</em> again.</p>

	<h2>Actions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Move:</strong> Move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>. </li>
		<li><strong>Attack:</strong> Make an <em>attack</em> with a weapon. See below. You can also <em>move</em> before or after.</li>
		<li><strong>Magic:</strong> Cast a spell or use a magic item. See Magic. You must not have taken damage this <em>round</em> in order to cast a spell.</li>
		<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Until the end of the next <em>round</em>, you have <em>advantage</em> on <em>dodges</em>, <em>saves</em>, <em>attacks</em>, and <em>checks</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Sprint:</strong> <em>Move</em> twice. Make a <em>constitution check</em>. Make this check with advantage if you are not wearing armor made of metal. If you fail, you are <em>bad</em> during the next <em>round</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Stunts:</strong> Other maneuvers are stunts. See below. </li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Stunts</h2>
	<p>the idea of <em>stunts</em> encompasses grappling, tripping, and any other kind of creative option. <em>Stunts</em> may not cause damage directly, but can do about anything else.</p>
	<p>How <em>stunts</em> are resolved is up to the dungeon master. These are provided as examples.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Shove:</strong> a <em>hit</em> has a 3-in-6 chance of moving an enemy to an adjacent <em>zone</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Intimidation:</strong> with a successful <em>charisma check</em>, force enemies to make a <em>moral check</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Disarm:</strong> a <em>hit</em> grants a <em>dexterity check</em> to disarm an enemy.</li> 
		<li><strong>Sunder:</strong> a <em>hit</em> deals one damage to the weapon or armor.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Attacking</h2>
	<h3>Statistics</h3>
	<p>The Armor Class (AC) is how likely a target is to be hit. </p>
	<p>The Attack Value (AV), also called THAC0, is how likely an attack is to miss.</p>
	<p>Lower AC and AV are better.</p>
	<p>The Dungeon Master might either announce the result of the <em>attack</em>, or tell you the AC/AV so you can announce it yourself.</p>
	<h3>Making an Attack</h3>
	<p>To <em>attack</em>, subtract a d20 from your AV. If it is less than or equal to the AC, you <em>hit</em>. Otherwise, you <em>miss</em>.</p>
	<p><em>Melee attacks</em> have a range of <em>touch</em>. <em>ranged attacks</em> have a range <em>distant</em> (i.e. in adjacent <em>zones</em> or closer).</p>
	<h3>Dodging an Attack</h3>
	<p>To dodge an attack, roll a d20 and add your AC. If it is less than or equal to the AV, the attack is a <em>miss</em>. Otherwise, it is a <em>hit</em></p>
	
	<h2>Exhaustion</h2>
	<p>At the end of the 9th <em>round</em>, and each <em>round</em> after, all creatures still involved in the <em>combat</em> take 1 damage.</p>

	<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
	<h3>Flanking</h3>
	<p>In melee, if one side surrounds the other, the surrounded side has a +4 penalty to AC. </p>
	<h3>Friendly Fire</h3>
	<p>When a ranged attack <em>misses</em>, players make a <em>dexterity check</em> to void hitting an ally. Monsters and minons have a 3-in-6 chance.</p>
	<h3>Mapping</h3>
	<p>During conflict, it's possible to reference a map, but adding to a map is impossible. The dungeon master will not make <em>map calls</em>. See page X</p>
	<h3>Subdual</h3>
	<p>If a creature is <em>slain</em> with a blunt weapon, they can be left non-leathally incapacitated, and <em>bad</em> until a <em>shift</em>.</p>
