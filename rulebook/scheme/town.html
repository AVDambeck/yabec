	<h1>Town</h1>
	<p>The game often starts slowly as people gather, are late, loose character sheets, etc. Town is this pendantic meander towards playing the real game. To efficiate the process, here is the check list:</p>
	<h2>Checklist</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Everyone has a character sheet.</li>
		<li>Returning characters heal completely, and do downtime</li>
		<li>Make sure the party has torches, rations, and other essentials</li>
		<li>Hire minions (if 2nd level)</li>
	</ul>
	<p> When everything is in order, begin <em>travel</em></p>
	<h2>Shopping</h2>
	<p>Every town will have the <em>basic</em> items availble. Some towns may have additional shops. Ask your Dungeon Master.</p>
	<h2>Minions</h2>
	<p>If there is a chracter of 2nd level or greater, 1d4 human hirelings will seek employment. If the total level of the party is 15 or greater, 2d6 2nd level hirelings will seek emplyment.</p>
	<h2>Downtime</h2>
	<p>The first time in <em>town</em> per session, returning characters get one <em>downtime</em>. See .....</p>
	<p>Characters who owe <em>service</em> must preform it before puruing other options.</p>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Each session, the players may agree to set one goal for the party. If the goal has already been completed in the past, or is not difficult enough, the Dungeon Master may reject it.</p>
	<p>Completing a goal is a <em>score</em>. See Experience.</p>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Kill a the bear with the scarred eye.</li>
		<li>Get to the third level of the dungeon.</li>
