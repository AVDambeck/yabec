	<h1>Clean Up</h1>
	<h2>Award Experience</h2>
	<p>The <em>score keeper</em> confers with the dungeon master to confirm each of the <em>scores</em> and their value. Then totals it and divides it by the surviving players.</p>
	<p>See <a href="../system/experience.html">Experience</a> for more details.</p>
	<h2>Divide treasure</h2>
	<p>Players split up the treasure between them (and their minions if agreed).</p>
	<p>Money is typically split evenly, while magic items have conflicting calls diced or bargined for.</p>
	<h2>Funerary Rites</h2>
	<p>When a character is buried in town, a funral can be given. For each cp spent on the funeral, that player gains 1 XP. In addition, all players that attend the funeral gain XP equal to 10% of the total cp spent.</p>
	<h2>Evaluate Loyalty</h2>
	<p>Minions, if any, adjust their <em>loyalty</em> score.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If their boss chooses to pay their wages a second time, they gain one point. </li>
		<li>If an animal or monster got to eat its favorite prey, they gain one point. </li>
		<li>If a hireling died that session, non-monster hirelings with the same boss loose one point.</li>
		<li>If a hireling or monster completed a goal, they gain one point.</li>
		<li>They may gain or loose more points at the referee’s discretion.</li>
