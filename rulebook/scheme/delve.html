	<h1>Dungeon</h1>
<p>Exploring a dangerous dungeon.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<h3>Turns</h3>
<p><em>Actions</em> will take a <em>turn</em> to complete. Each <em>turn</em>, the Dungeon Master will check for <em>hazards</em> (see below). </p>
<h3>Free Actions</h3>
<p>Free "actions" do not impact the <em>turns</em> and can be done freely, to an extent. </p>
<ul>
<li>Moving and looking around the current <em>zone</em> are free actions.</li>
<li>Checking doors.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a rule of thumb, gathering information is free, changing the environment ia an <em>action</em>. See The Conversation.</p>
<h3>Marching Order</h3>
<p>While moving in narrow hallways, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the <em>front</em> and the <em>back</em> are significant. </p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>This is a non-exaustive list of the <em>actions</em> players might take in a dungeon.</p>
<h3>Move</h3>
<p>Move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>.</p>
<h3>Run</h3>
<p>Move at reckless pace. Move through 6 <em>zones</em>. During this, players are <em>surprised</em> by all encounters, spring all traps, create <em>loud</em> noise, cannot map, and cannot check doors.</p>
<h3>Parlay</h3>
<p>Converse with the dungeon denizens. </p>
<h4>Reaction roll</h4>
<p>The Dungeon Master might ask for a <em>reaction modifier</em>. see character p4.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master might make the roll at advantage or disadvantage, depending on the player’s actions.
A high roll will make the monsters more friendly. A low roll will make them more hostile. A very high or very low roll will also make them <em>bad</em> for one <em>round</em>. See Dungeon Master p15.</p>
<h3>Conflict</h3>
<p>One <em>conflict</em> will take one <em>turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>Searching reveals non-obvious features, such as traps. A search will always reveal everything it can.</p>
<p>Searching will also reclaim one half of ammo.</p>
<h4>Splitting Up</h4>
<p>Seaching a <em>zone</em> takes three people one <em>turn</em>, or one person two <em>turn</em>. </p>
<h3>Rest</h3>
<p>Removes <em>fatigue</em>. Ignore the <em>fatigue hazard</em> while resting.</p>
<h3>Bandage</h3>
<p>Bandages can be used to gain some healing. Make an <em>intelligence</em> check. If you succeed, heal the target 1d6, plus a bonus from your wisdom. See <em>ability scores</em>. You may bandage yourself.</p>
<p>Bandaging consumes a bandage. Once you are bandaged, you can not be bandaged again until you are <em>damaged</em>.</p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>
<p>At the end of each <em>turn</em>, the Dungeon master will check for <em>hazards</em>. </p>
<p>Differnet enviornments will have different odds, but generally, there's 1-in-6 chance of each hazard. Some areas may have more or less wandering monsters, some areas may have additional <em>hazards</em>. etc.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master should knock on the table to indicate the <em>turn</em>.</p>
<h3>Burn</h3>
<p>Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.</p>
<h3>Fatigue</h3>
<p>Become <em>fatigued</em>. Anyone already <em>fatigued</em> takes 1 damage. </p>
<h3>Shift</h3>
<p>Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.</p>
<h3>Wandering Monsters</h3>
<p>In dangerous or unstable areas, monsters may begin hunting you.</p>
<h2>Doors</h2>
<p>Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a <em>shift</em>.</p>
<p>Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. </p>
<h3>Checking Doors</h3>
<p>Once per <em>turn</em>, a player can check a door. </p>
<p>Each door can only be checked once. </p>
<p>The Dungeon Master rolls a d6. 
- <strong>Peephole:</strong> If there is a peep hole, or cracks, +2.
- <strong>Class:</strong> If a player has a bonus from their class, add only the strongest bonus. 
- <strong>Results:</strong> A roll of 5 or more will reveal information. Revealing “nothing” or “darkness” is indicative of either a failure, or accurately assessing a dark quiet room</p>
<h3>Failing to open</h3>
<p>Attempting to open a stuck, bared, or locked door fails <em>loudly</em>. </p>
<h3>Breaking Doors</h3>
<p>Physically destroying a door is an <em>action</em>, requires appropriate tools, and makes <em>loud</em> noise. </p>
<h2>Varient Rule: Flashback</h2>
<p>Each session, each player may have up to one flashback. The following are provided as suggestions.</p>
<p>In general, anything that could have been done in town can be done as a flashback.</p>
<h3>Purchase</h3>
<p>Have gotten a particular item while shopping. </p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>Role play a brief conversation had before the adventure. </p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Role play the origin of a character.</p>
<h3>Preperation</h3>
<p>How were you prepared for an unexpected challenge?</p>
<h2>Fleeing the Dungon</h2>
<p>Once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. </p>
<p>Each <em>round</em>, move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>, then one character must take 1d4 damage. </p></body></html>
