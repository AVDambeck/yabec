	<h1>Dungeon</h1>
	<h2>Procedure</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Listen</li>
		<li>Open door</li>
		<li>Movement</li>
		<li>Reaction</li>
		<li>Mapping</li>
		<li>Searching</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Listening</h2>
	<p><em>Listening</em> at a door or corridor can reveal what lies beyond. Roll a d6, and add the bonus from your <em>wisdom</em> score (Some classes, like thieves, have additional bonuses). On a result of six or more, the dunegon master will reveal sounds you are able to hear.</p>
	<h2>Opening Doors</h2>
	<p>When opening a door, <em>check</em> your <em>strength</em>. If you fail, the door makes a <em>loud</em> sound. Otherwise, the door opens <em>silently</em>.
	<p>Only a player at the <em>front</em> of the marching order can open doors; opening a door implies moving to the <em>front</em>.
	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a <em>shift</em>.</p>
	<p>Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. </p>
	<p>Physically destroying a door is an <em>action</em>, requires appropriate tools, and makes <em>loud</em> noise. </p>
<h2>basics</h2>
	<h2>Movement</h2>
	<h3>Marching Order</h3>
	<p>While moving through narrow doors and halls, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the <em>front</em> and the <em>back</em> are significant. </p>
	<h3>Distance</h3>
	<p>If no other <em>events</em> happen, moving through three <em>zones</em> (i.e. three rooms), is an <em>event</em>. By moving quickly through a familiar area, you can move upto nine <em>zones</em> instead.
	<h3>Reaction</h3>
	<p>When the players enter a room unnoticed (i.e. they haven't made <em>loud</em> sounds), they <em>surprise</em> any monsters in the room, and have an advantage.</p> 
	<p>Depending on how each side reacts, there may be a converstaion, or a <em>combat</em>, both of which are <em>events</em>.</p>
	<p>The dungeon master might ask for a <em>reaction modifier</em> to deternine the monsters reaction. Use the highest modifier amung players in the <em>front</em>.
	<h3>Mapping</h3>
	<p>Once the reaction is settled, players are able to observe the room for long enough to add to their <a href="mapping.html">map</a>.</p>
	<h3>Searching</h3>
	<p>Very little treasure will be obvious at first glance. <em>Searching</em>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reveals all non-obvious features, such as traps.</li>
		<li>Will always reveal everything it can.</li>
		<li>Is an <em>event</em>.</li>
		<li>Takes a minimum of three people per <em>zone</em>.</li>
	</u>
	<h3>Rest</h3>
	<p>Removes <em>fatigue</em>. Ignore the <em>fatigue hazard</em> while resting.</p>

	<h2>Turns</h2>
	<p>The completion of an <em>event</em> marks the end of a <em>turn</em>. Each <em>turn</em>, the Dungeon Master will check for <em>hazards</em>.</p>
	<h3>hazards</h3>
	<p>Differnet enviornments will have different odds, but generally, there's 1-in-6 chance of each hazard. Some areas may have more or less wandering monsters, some areas may have additional <em>hazards</em>, etc.</p>
	<p>The dungeon master should knock on the table to indicate the <em>hazard</em>.</p>
	<h3>Burn</h3>
	<p>Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.</p>
	<h3>Fatigue</h3>
	<p>Become <em>fatigued</em>. Anyone already <em>fatigued</em> takes 1 damage. </p>
	<h3>Shift</h3>
	<p>Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.</p>
	<h3>Wandering Monsters</h3>
	<p>In dangerous or unstable areas, monsters may begin hunting you.</p>

	<h2>fleeing the Dungon</h2>
	<p>once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. </p>
	<p>each <em>round</em>, move to an adjacent <em>zone</em>. Then one character must take 1d4 damage. </p>
