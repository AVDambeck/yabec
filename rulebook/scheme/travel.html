	<h1>Travel</h1>
	<p>Significant locations are represented by <em>points</em>. Routes between them are represented by <em>paths</em>. 
	<h2>Paths</h2>
	<p>You can move from one <em>point</em> to the next by paying a cost. There are three types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Safe Path</em>: This path cost 1 ration per person to travel.</li>
		<li><em>Risky Path</em>: This path costs 1 ration per person to travel, and has a chance of random encounter.</li>
		<li><em>Toll Path</em>: This path has a price in silver to travel.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Points</h2>
	<p>There are three types of <em>point</em>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Soft</em>: Small feature which may be <em>explored</em>, e.g. an entrance to a cave.</li>
		<li><em>Hard</em>: Feature which must be <em>explored</em> e.g. a narrow pass in a mountain range.</li>
		<li><em>Civ</em>: Option to either <em>town</em>, <em>clean up</em>, or (so long as you aren't notorious) pass by.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Foraging</h2>
	<p>At any time the party may choose to <em>forage</em>: each character rolls a d6. On a 5, they find one ration. On a 6, the find two. On a 1-4, they take 1d6 damage.</p>
	<p>In dangerous areas, you might have to <em>forage</em> with <em>disadvantage</em>.</p>
