	<h1>Appendix A - Additional Notes<h1>
	<h2>Modification</h2>
	<p>The book is meant to act as a standard reference for how the Dungeon Master makes rulings. While the Dungeon Master's call is ultimently final, its recommended to stick to the book, and later change unsatisfactory rules. Yabec is open source, and available on Github.</p>
	<p>If players don't like the rules, they should begin a conversation about how they would like the rule, and the kind of game they are interested in playing. When an agreement is made, it should be reflected in the book. If they have other games they are interested in playing, they should also bring those to the conversation. /gen</p>
	<p>The book also acts as a suggest stock of rulings. If the Dungeon Master should be able to appeal to the book, and get a simple but opinionated rule. The new rule should not disrupt the flow of play, but rather maintain it. If the rule turns unfun, it should be ammended via the above process.</p>
	<h2>Metagaming Comment</h2>
	<p>I have a lax approach to metagaming. Any info gained during the session is valid, including;</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Info from dead characters.</li>
	<li>Deduced AC and Hit Dice.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>What would be metagaming would be searching the internet for answers, or reading the adventure source books.</p>
	<p>This comment is meant to give the superflous mechanical permision to do this.</p>
