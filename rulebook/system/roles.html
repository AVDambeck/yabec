<h1>Player Roles</h1>
<p>There are several optional <em>roles</em> that players can have. Using <em>roles</em> makes play smoother and easier for the Dungeon Master. Use a notecard or token to keep track of <em>roles</em>. </p>
<p>In addition to potentially being a <em>score</em> for the party, taking on a <em>role</em> during <em>town</em> scores awards 50 XP to that character. 100 XP for Callers and Mappers.</p>
<p>If a player with a <em>role</em> dies, another player may take on that <em>role</em>. </p>
<p>Its possible to have multipule of most <em>roles</em>. For example, there can be a Caller for delving and a Caller for combat, or two Mappers that check eachother's work.</p>
<h2>Chair</h2>
<p>Make sure roles are filled. Go through each role, ask for volunteers.</p>
<h2>Score Keeper</h2>
<p>Keep track of <em>scores</em>, such as looted treasure, and defeated monsters. See experience.</p>
<h2>Quater Master</h2>
<p>Keep track of torches, bandages, and other equipment.</p>
<h2>Mapper</h2>
<p>Keep track of the layout of the dungeon. If you'd like, ask the Dungeon Master for exact <em>map calls</em>. See mapping.</p>
<h2>Caller</h2>
<p>Get consensus on what the party would like to do, and communicate to the Dungeon Master.</p>
<h2>Scribe</h2>
<p>Keep track of the different monsters and traps, their behaviors, mechanics, and even their combat statistics (depending on the Dungeon Master's approach to metagaming).</p>
