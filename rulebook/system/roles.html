	<h1>Player Roles</h1>
	<p>Using <em>roles</em> makes play smoother and easier for the dungeon master.</p>
	<p>In addition to potentially being a <em>score</em> for the party, taking on a <em>role</em> during <em>town</em> scores awards 50 XP to that character. 100 XP for <em>callers</em> and <em>mappers</em>.</p>
	<p>Its possible to have multiple of most <em>roles</em>. For example, there can be a <em>caller</em> for exploration and a <em>caller</em> for combat, or two <em>mappers</em> that check each other's work.</p>
	<h2>Mapper</h2>
	<p>Keep track of the layout of the dungeon. If you'd like, ask the Dungeon Master for exact <em>map calls</em>. See mapping.</p>
	<h2>Caller</h2>
	<p>Get consensus on what the party would like to do, and communicate to the Dungeon Master.</p>
	<h2>Chair</h2>
	<p>Make sure that all the <em>roles</em> are filled.</p>
	<h2>Score Keeper</h2>
	<p>Keep track of <em>scores</em>, such as looted treasure, and defeated monsters. See experience.</p>
	<h2>Scribe</h2>
	<p>Keep track of the different monsters and traps, their behaviors, mechanics, and even their combat statistics (depending on the Dungeon Master's approach to metagaming).</p>
	<h2>Quarter Master</h2>
	<p>Keep track of torches, bandages, and other equipment. Keep track of loot as it collected.</p>
