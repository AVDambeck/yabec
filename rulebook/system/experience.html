	<h1>Experience</h1>

<p>At the end of the session, the Score Keeper will confer with the DM to confirm each <em>score</em>, and establish the total amount of XP. </p>
<p>XP is divided evenly between all surviving characters. The Score Keeper will announce the individual amount gained.</p>
<h3>Minions</h3>
<p>If a player is 2nd level or higher, their minions  gain the same amount of XP. </p>
<h3>Variant Rule: Prime Requisite</h3>
<p>Each class has one or two prime requisites, which grants bonus XP for having a high <em>ability score</em>.</p>
<p>Characters with at least a 9 in one prime requisite gain 5% extra XP. </p>
<p>Characters with at least a 9 in both gain 15% extra XP.</p>
<p>Characters with at least a 16 in one prime requisite gain 15% extra XP.</p>
