		<h1>Mapping</h1>
	<p>Dungeons are complex environments where it is easy to get lost. Keeping a map is essential. Its recommended that one player take on the role of Mapper. See Roles.</p>
	<p> GFC's video "SPEEDY DUNGEON MAPS in D&D! GIT GUD at CALLING YOUR MAPS!" is a perfect explanation of dungeon mapping.

	<p>A text version of this system is available on the web version of Yabec.</p>
	<h2>Simple Method</h2>
	<p>Rather than track the exact dimensions of every room, the mapper might opt to keep a general shape of the dungeon.</p>
	<p>The mapper draws a loose flow chart, labeling rooms and their connections.</p>
