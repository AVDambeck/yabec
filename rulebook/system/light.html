<h1>Light</h1>
<h2>Levels</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of light:</p>
<h3>Dark</h3>
<p>The <em>darkness</em> is pitch black, and prevents sight. Imposess blindness.</p>
<h3>Dim</h3>
<p>Allows some detail to be seen.</p>
<h3>Bright</h3>
<p>Allows full vision, including details and reading. Disables <em>infravision</em>.</p>
<h2>Distance</h2>
<p>A light source casts <em>bright</em> light within <em>touch</em>, and <em>dim</em> within <em>distant</em>. </p>
<h2>Infravision</h2>
<p>A special type of vision had by many monsters: seeing heat energy that radiats of living things. </p>
<p>When a creature with <em>infravision</em> stands in <em>bright</em>, they are blinded for one round, and their <em>infravision</em> is disabled until they spend a full <em>turn</em> in the <em>dark</em>.</p>
<p>It is not possible to read in the <em>dim</em> or <em>dark</em> with <em>infravision</em>. </p>
<h2>Blindness</h2>
<p>Creatures who are unable to perceive their surroundings are <em>bad</em>.</p></body></html>
