	<h1>Distance</h1>
	<h2>Zones</h2>
	<p>The dungeon environment is split into <em>zones</em>. As a rule of thumb, each room and hallway is a <em>zone</em>. Large rooms or hallways may be multipole <em>zones</em>. </p>
	<h3>Guidelines</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Architectural features, such as doorways, should divide <em>zones</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>40':</strong> Rooms bigger than 40', and hallways longer than 40', should be multiple <em>zones</em>.</li>
		<li><strong>Even:</strong> Large rooms and hallways should have their <em>zones</em> divided evenly. </li>
		<li><strong>Whole Number:</strong> Large rooms and hallways should always have a whole number of <em>zones</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Ranges</h2>
	<p>Ranges and relative location are divided into four <em>ranges</em>.</p>
	<h3>Touch</h3>
	<p>Striking distance. </p>
	<h3>Close</h3>
	<p>Throwing distance. Speaking distance. With in the same <em>zone</em>.</p>
	<h3>Distant</h3>
	<p>Shouting distance. In adjacent <em>zones</em>. Farthest distance to make out details (in <em>bright</em> light). </p>
	<p>In dark environments, the player's torch will often be the limit of their sight. This means that anything within torch light is <em>distant.</em></p>
	<h3>Sight</h3>
	<p>Anything that can be seen. Up to 3 miles in ideal conditions.</p>
