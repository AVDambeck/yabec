	<h1>Evasion</h1>
	<p>When two groups encounter one another, one or both may decide to evade the other, or one group may decide to purse the evading group.</p>
	<h2>Decision</h2>
	<p>If both groups choose to evade, nothing happens.</p>
	<p>If one group chooses to evade, and they are not pursed, nothing happens.</p>
	<p>If one group chooses to evade, and is pursed, the chance of successfuly evading is 3-in-6. If they fail, begin <em>combat</em></p>
	<p>If one group is hidden from the other and choses to evade, they succeed automatically, and without alerting them.</p>
