	<h1>Rolls</h1>
	<p>This page details a lot of different kinds of rolls.</p>
	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<p>There are six abilities: <em>strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom,</em> and <em>charisma</em>. They're rated from 3, the worst, to 18, the best.</p>
	<h3>Checking</h3>
	<p>You succeed if d20 &lt;= the ability score. (low roll good)</p>
	
	<h2>Saves</h2>
	<p>All characters and monsters can make <em>saves</em> to avoid the full effects of certain traps, spells, and attacks.</p>
	<p>Having a lower save value is better.</p>
	<h3>Categories:</h3>
	<p>There are five saving throw categories:
	- <strong>Death (D):</strong> When targeted by a death ray, or exposed to poison.
	- <strong>Weird (W):</strong> When exposed to radiation or other worlds.
	- <strong>Paralysis or Petrification (P):</strong> When targeted by an effect that paralyses or turns to stone.
	- <strong>Blast (B):</strong> When target by dragon breath or explosions.
	- <strong>Spells or magic (S)</strong> When targeted by a baneful spell or effect from a magic item. </p>
	<p>Your class's progression table determines you <em>save</em> values. </p>
	<h3>Checking</h3>
	<p>You succeed if d20 &gt;= <em>save</em> value. (high roll good)</p>
	<p>Success against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved. Otherwise, the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.</p>
	
	<h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
	<h3>Advantage</h3>
	<p>When making a roll with <em>advantage</em>, roll an additional time for each <em>advantage</em>. Take the best roll.</p>
	<h3>Disadvantage</h3>
	<p>When making a roll with <em>disadvantage</em>, roll twice and take the worse.</p>
	<h3>Combination.</h3>
	<p>One <em>disadvantage</em> and one <em>advantage</em> cancel out.</p>
	
	<h2>Variant Rule: Heroism</h2>
	<p>Push yourself. Take 2 damage or reduce you <em>constitution score</em> by one. Choose one:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gain <em>advantage</em> on one <em>check</em>.</li>
		<li>Take an action dispite <em>bad</em> with <em>disadvantage</em>.</li>
	</ul>
