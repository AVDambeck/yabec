<h2>Detect Construction</h2>
<p>When searching, dwarves also detect new construction, sliding walls, sloping passages and other stone architectural features. See Error: Reference source not found, page 8.</p>
<h2>Infravision</h2>
<p>Dwarves have infravision. See Global p10.</p>
<h2>Tough</h2>
<p>Dwarves dismember with a advantage. See Global, page 20.</p>
<h2>Berserker</h2>
<p>While a dwarf has damage equal to or greater than 50% of their health, their AV is reduced by 4.</p>
<h2>After Reaching 9th Level</h2>
<p>A dwarf has the option of creating an underground bhold that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character’s clan will be attracted to live under their roof. Dwarves from other clans will generally be friendly and clans may collaborate in times of war or disaster.</p>
<p>A dwarf ruler may only hire dwarven mercenaries. However specialists and hirelings of any race may be hired. </p>
