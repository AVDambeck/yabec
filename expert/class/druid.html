<h2>Identification</h2>
<p>Druids can identify plants, animals and clean water.</p>
<h2>Shape Change</h2>
<p>At 2nd level, a druid gains the ability to change into animals. </p>
<h3>Shapes Known</h3>
<p>A druid can know as many shapes as their level. Learning a knew shape requires three observations, which must be on unique individuals, and on separate days. </p>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>Observation takes one turn and requires the druid to be unnoticed. </p>
<h3>Transforming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can only be used once per day.</li>
<li>Lasts a number of turns equal to the druid’s level. </li>
<li>Follows the same rules as spell casting. </li>
<li>Must be holding the bone or hide of the animal. </li>
<li>The animal must have hit dice equal to or less than the druid’s level. </li>
<li>If a druid has lost hit points, they regain 1d4 hit points per level upon changing into an animal. </li>
<li>All equipment carried by the druid is absorbed into the animal form and reappears when the druid changes back.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nature’s Favor</h2>
<p>Due to their ability to forage, druids do not need to consume rations when <em>traveling</em>.</p>
<h2>Pass Without Trace</h2>
<p>From 3rd level, a druid can pass through natural environments without leaving any tracks. A druid is also able to move through overgrown areas at normal speed and without impediment</p>
<h2>Charm Immunity</h2>
<p>Druids of 7th level and above are immune to charms.</p>
<h2>Reaching 12th Level and Above</h2>
<p>There can only be nine druids of 12th level. When a druid has enough experience to reach 12th level, they must challenge an existing 12th level druid. The character only advances to 12th level if the other druid is defeated. Such challenges may take any form that is agreed by both parties, including combat (which need not be fatal). Likewise, there can only be three druids of 13th level and a single druid (known as the arch-druid) of 14th level.</p>
<p>Druids who attain 12th level or above may have a bhold magically integrated into a natural setting.  </p>
<p>2d12 beings will join the ranger as followers. The nature of these followers is up to the referee.</p>
