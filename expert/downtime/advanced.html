	<h1>Advanced Downtime</h1>
	<p>These downtime activies are only available to certain classes, and only to 2nd level characters.</p>
	<h2>creating magic Items</h2>
	<p>Only magic-users of 9th level or higher can create magic items. </p>
	<p>The player describes in detail the item that they wish. The Dungeon Master decides whether this is possible and, if so, what materials are required.</p>
	<h3>Restrictions</h3>
	<p>Divine spell casters May only create items that they are able to use themselves. Arcane spell casters may create any item except those that may only be used by divine spell casters.</p>
	<h3>Materials</h3>
	<p>Creating magic items requires rare components such as expensive gems or ingredients from rare monsters. </p>
	<h3>Cost and Time</h3>
	<p>If duplicating the effects of a spell, construction costs one week and 5g, per level of the mimicked spell, multiplied by the number of uses.</p>
	<p>The Dungeon Master must use discretion for other items. As a general rule, items should cost from 100 to 1000gp and from 4 to 52  weeks to complete. </p>
	<h2>Crime</h2>
	<p>Only Thieves, Acrobats, Animalkin, Kobold and Warlocks can pursue crime. </p>
	<p>Thieves have <em>advantage</em> on <em>ability checks</em> made for crime.</p>
	<h3>Heist</h3>
	<p>A <em>heist</em> is a single large crime or scheme. Get a note card to keep track of your progress on the <em>heist</em>.</p>
	<h3>Tilling a Vacancy</h3>
	<p>Scoping out a new <em>heist</em> takes one week. </p>
	<ol>
	<li>Write the location and the target on your <em>heist</em> card.</li>
	<li>Roll a number of d12 equal to your level. This is the <em>value</em> of the <em>heist</em> in sp.</li>

	</ol>
	<h4>Boredom</h4>
	<p>If your up for a challenge, the <em>heat</em> of the <em>heist</em> becomes 10, and the <em>value</em> increases tenfold.</p>
	<h3>Risk</h3>
	<p>Whenever you take a <em>risk</em>, cross off an <em>ability score</em> from your <em>hiest</em> card. If none remain, take your pick instead. <em>Check</em> that <em>ability</em>. If you fail, there is an X-in-8 chance of <em>trouble</em> where x is the the <em>heat</em> of the <em>heist</em>. </p>
	<p>After the first <em>trouble</em>, the hiest looses two <em>potential</em>, gains one <em>heat</em>. And, you must pay a fine equal to twice the <em>value</em> of the <em>heist</em>, and preform a week of service. </p>
	<p>After the second <em>trouble</em>, you end the <em>heist</em>, pay a fine of four times the <em>value</em>, and must preform two weeks of service. </p>
	<h4>Loosing a Glove</h4>
	<p>If you are unable to pay the fine, you instead have a hand cut off. </p>
	<h3>Actions</h3>
	<p>Each week, you can take one action on an existing <em>heist</em>.</p>
	<h4>Bite the Blow</h4>
	<p>If the hiest has at least one <em>potential</em>, take a <em>risk</em> to get paid 20% of the <em>value</em>. 
	Reduce the <em>potential</em> by one.</p>
	<h4>Fence</h4>
	<p>When a <em>heist</em> has zero <em>potential</em>, take a <em>risk</em> to end the <em>heist</em>, and get paid 100% the <em>value</em>. </p>
	<h4>Till a Rounder</h4>
	<p>Invite another character to the <em>heist</em>. Each week, including this one, they can use their downtime to take one action.</p>
	<h4>Pay the Prigs</h4>
	<p>Add an NPC accomplice’s name to the <em>heist</em> card. 
	Each accomplice takes a 10% cut, but gives a -2 bonus on the <em>ability check</em> for <em>risk</em>.</p>

	<p>Increase the <em>potential</em> by one. </p>
