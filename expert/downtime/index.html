	<h1>Downtime</h1>
	<p>During <em>town</em> returning characters can preform one downtime action. If they owe service, they must preform that instead of downtime.</p>
	<p>These are presented in catagories</p>
	<h2>Service</h2>
	<p>Preforming service at the temple has no direct benifite.</p> 
	<p>Divine spell-casters who choose to preform service volunterially might be able to forgive diety disfavor. The chance is equal to their level, plus their <em>wisdom</em>, out of 100.</p>
	<p>Except for the first time doing service, chaotic aligned characters can hire a goon to do service for them. The first time it costs 100 cp. Each time after costs 1% more, compounding. Diety disfavor can not be forgiven this way.</p> 
	<h2>City Life</h2>
	<h3>Baking</h3>
	<p>Help at the local bakery. Heal 1d6, if you are ar full HP, prevent the next 2 damage that would be dealt to you this session.
	<h3>Healing</h3>
	<p>A stay in the temple costs 100 cp, or one week of service. It completely heals you, cures mundane illnesses, has a 5-in-6 chance of curing mundane toxins, and a 2-in-6 chance of removing minor cureses.</p>
	<h3>Gambling</h3>
	<p>Play a number of games of <a href="gambling.html">Dragon Ante</a> equal to thrice your level.</p>
	<p>You might also hear rumors. Make two <em>charisma checks</em>. For each you succeed, ask the Dungeon Master for a rumor.
	<h3>Selling</h3>
	<p>Try to get a better buy on your treasure.</p>
	<p>Each downtime, you can find buyers for treasure equal to 100 cp times your level. If a single object is more valuable than that, you must work for several downtimes to sell it.</p>
	<p>When you sell the item, roll d% on the table, and add your <em>charisma</em> score. </p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th> d% </th>
			<th> Sale </th>
