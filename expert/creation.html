<h1>Advanced Character Creation</h1>
<p>This method of character creation is designed to grant more freedom and flexibilty than the <a href="/basic/creation.html">Basic Charater Creation</a></p>
<p>Get a sheet of paper, or print out a character sheet, to record all of your cracter's details.</p>
<h2>Ability Scores</h2>
<p>Choose either one of these arrays, and assign them however you like to the six stats <em>strength</em>, <em>dexterity</em>, <em>constitution</em>, <em>intelligence</em>, <em>wisdom</em>, and <em>charisma</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>13, 13, 11, 11, 9, 9</li>
<li>16, 13, 10, 8, 6, 5</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional: Rolling ability scores.</h3>
<p>If you wish, you can instead roll 3d6 seven times and use six of them to create a new array.</p>
