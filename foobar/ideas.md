# Flow
- some way that runs get better as they go, instead of always peetering out
    - Class abilities: Warlock gets better when damaged. Fighter can build momentum.
    - Does this fundementally alter the function of the game?

# Character
- number go up ability scores
## Die less
- standard array for stats
- max hp at first level
## Tweaks
- wizards use mana instead of vancian?
- skill classes gain one each level, for fighter, theif, etc.
## Classes
- outlander: better at bandaging, focus on healing, better at charting. 

# Misc
