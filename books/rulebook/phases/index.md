%INDEX%

A *phase* is a scheme for how guide the conversation.

There are four *phases*. Each is detailed fully in it's own chapter.
### Town
Players navigate an urban setting, often splitting up to do *downtime*, or go shopping. The *phase* ends when the players *depart* on an *adventure*.
### Delve
Players explore a dangerous dungeon. This *phase* ends when the players leave the dungeon. Then *clean up*.
### Conflict
Players fight or flee from monsters. This *phase* occers within a *delve*, or rarely, in a *town*.
### Clean Up 
Handle experience, splitting treasure, and other loose ends. Either end the session here, or begin *town* again.
