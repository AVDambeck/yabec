## Item Slots (Inventory)
In order to carry an item, the character must have a free item *slot* to carry it. 
- **Most Items:** One *slot*.
- **Heavy Items:** Two *slots*.
- **Stack Items:** Five per *slot*.
- **Person or body:** Three *slots*.
### Number
A character has a base of five *slots*, plus a bonus from their *stength*.
Backpacks grant additional *slots*. Chests and carts can be used to carry even more.

Minions also have item *slots*, typically five.
### Encumberance
Becoming *encumbered* doubles a creature's *slots*.
*Encumbered* creatures are *bad*, but can *attack* with disadvantage, and move at half speed.
### Horses
A horse can carry a person and their items, OR twenty *slots* plus pulling a cart or wagon.
A passnger and their items occupy ten *slots* in a cart or wagon.

## Abilities
There are six abilities: *strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom,* and *charisma*. They're rated from 3, the worst, to 18, the best.
### Checking
The DM may use ability scores to determine success.

You succeed if d20 <= the ability score. (low roll good)
### Low Ability Score
If a character has an ability score reduced to less than three, they die.

## Saving Throws
All characters and monsters can make *saves* to avoid the full effects of certain traps, spells, and attacks.
### Catagories:
There are five saving throw catagories:
- **Death (D):** When targeted by a death ray, or exposed to poison.
- **Weird (W):** When exposed to radiation or other worlds.
- **Paralysis or Petrification (P):** When targeted by an efect that paralyses or turns to stone.
- **Blast (B):** When target by dragon breath or explosions.
- **Spells or magic (S)** When targeted by a banefull spell or effect from a magic item. 

Each class has its own table denoting the *save* values based on the level. Monsters have their own table, see page X. LINK
### Checking
You succeed if d20 >= *save* value. (high roll good)

Success against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved. Otherwise, the effect has been entierly avoided or negated.

## bad
*bad* is a generalized status conditions. 

*attacks* and *stealth* against *bad* targets always succeed. 

*bad* creatures can:
- hear.
- speak.
- *Save*.
- Desperate actions allowed by *badness*. For example, move randomly in the dark, or move inches while bound.  

*Bad* cretures can not:
- Move. 
- *Attack*.
- Cast spells.
- Use magic items.
- Use class skills.
- Sunder their shield.

Depending on the exact condition, *Bad* creatures might be able to take some limited action. For example, a blind creature may beable to move randomly, or a bound character might work to break out of their restraints.


## Stealth
To establish or maintain *stealth*, roll a d8. If it is less than or equal to the AC of the target, *stealth* is sucessful.

## Abandonment
A character of 2nd level or higher can be abandoned. They permanently leave the game. Abandonded characters can leave 50% of their wealth and 80% of their XP to a new adventurer.
