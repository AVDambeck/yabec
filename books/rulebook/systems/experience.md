# Experience
This chapter covers experience points (XP) and how it is awarded. XP is a measure of a PC's power and wealth, and creates progression.

## Score Card
At the start of the session, the Score Keeper will begin a score card: a simple piece of paper to write down *scores* as they happen.

At the end of the session, the Score Keeper will confer with the DM to confirm each *score*, and establish the total amount of XP. 

XP is divided evenly between all surviving characters. The Score Keeper will announce the individual amount gained.
### Minions
If a player is 2nd level or higher, their minions  gain the same amount of XP. 
### Variant Rule: Prime Requisite
Each class has one or two prime requisites, which grants bonus XP for having a high *ability score*.

Characters with at least a 9 in one prime requisite gain 5% extra XP. 

Characters with at least a 9 in both gain 15% extra XP.

Characters with at least a 16 in one prime requisite gain 15% extra XP.

## Scores
A *score* is anything that awards XP.
### Treasure.

## Leveling Up
When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level:

- Looks at your class progression tables and notes any improvements in saves, AV, spells, etc. 
- Roll your HD and add it to your HP.
- Gain an additional *downtime*. 
- Increase two different *ability scores* by 1, to a maximum of 18. At 9th and 14th level, you may instead increase one *ability* with an 18 to a 20.
### One Session Maximum
Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Leave the character 1 XP below the threshold for the next level. The remaining XP can be distributed among the other characters, as the player wishes. If all characters are 1 XP below the threshold, extra XP is wasted.
