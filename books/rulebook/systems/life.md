# Life & Death
This section covers health, damage, and dying.

Unlike many games which count HP down, Yabec counts damage up. 

## Health Points
Health points (HP) represent the ability to withstand injury and exaustion.
### Health Die (HD)
Health dice are used to determine HP. Each class has a diferent HD. Monsters have a d8 HD.

At 1st level, a character's HP is equal to the highest value on their HD.

## Healing
Healing removes damage.
### Magical Healing
Magic potions or spells can provid instantaneous healing.

When magically healing a *near death* character, they *dismember* with advantage.

## Damage
*Damage* represents injury, exaustion, and wear. 
### Slain
When a creature takes *damage* equal to or greater tan its HP, it is *slain*,
*Slain* minions and *ordinary* monsters instantly die. 
*Slain* PCs and *powerful* monsters are *near death*. See Near Death.
#### Destruction
If *slain* by fire, or explosion, items are destroyed, and PCs and *powerful* monsters instantly die. Magic items have a chance of miraculously surviving.
### Item Damage
Some items can become *damaged*. Items with four or more *damage* break completely. Magic items are immune to *damage*.

Each point of *damage* incurs a penalty:

- **Weapons:** -1 to damage rolls.
- **Armor:** +1 to AC.
- **Other:** -1 to any rolls made with it.

Dwarves are able to repair items as *downtime*. 

## Near Death
### Death
After a full *turn* *near death*, creatures die. 

If a creature takes any damage while *near death*, they *dismember*.
#### New Character
As soon as you have a new character sheet, the Dungeon Master will add your character at earliest contrivance. 
### Healing
When healed while *near death*, a creature instead rolls for *dismemberment*. If healed by magic, they roll with *advantage*.
### Dismemberment
Roll a d12, and add *constitution* score. Reference the table. If they survive, they heal 1.

| Result | Dismeberment                     |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| <= 11  | Dead!                            |
| 12     | Broken leg: +2 AC                |
| 13     | Lost arm                         |
| 14-15  | Lost eye                         |
| 16-17  | Concussion: -1d4 *wisdom* and *intelligence* |
| 18-20  | Torn muscle: -1d4 *dexterity*    |
| 21-23  | Bone fracture: -1d4 *strength*   |
| 24-26  | Broken rib: -1d4 *constitution*  |
| >=27   | Unharmed                         |

## After Death
### Burial
Simple burial prevents the vody from being reanimated.

Temples will burry and bless the dead for free.

Creamation prevents reanimation and is impossible to undo.
#### Rites
If a cleric uses one turn to preform a blessing, the soul will pass peacefully.

When funerary rites are preformed, the character sheet must be ripped up. Players are encouraged to give eulogy, play music, and create intricate rituals.
### Inheritance
When a character dies, their companions can loot their body.

Money and items stored in town will be subject to a 15% estate tax to local government or temple, and then inherited by the next of kin or listed heir.
### Resurrection
Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two weeks of bed rest, they have 1 HP, move at half the normal rate, can not carry *heavy*  items, cannot attack, cast spells, or use class skills. 

Each time a character is resurrected, their *constitution* is reduced by 1.
