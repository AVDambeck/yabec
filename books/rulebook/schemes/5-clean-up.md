# Clean Up

## Basics
### Award Experience
See Experience.
### Divide treasure
Players split up the treasure between them (and their minions if agreed).

Money is typically split evenly, while magic items have conflicting calls diced or bargined for.
### Funerary Rites
See life and death.
### Town
When *clean up* is finished, return to *town* or end the session.

## Evaluate Loyalty
At the end of each session the hirelings evaluate their loyalty.  
- If their boss chooses to pay their wages a second time, they gain one point. 
- If an animal or monster got to eat its favorite prey, they gain one point. 
- If a hireling died that session, non-monster hirelings with the same boss loose one point.
- If a hireling or monster completed a goal, they gain one point.
- They may gain or loose more points at the referee’s discretion.
