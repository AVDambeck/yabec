# Dungeon
Exploring a dangerous dungeon.

## Basics
### Turns
*Actions* will take a *turn* to complete. Each *turn*, the Dungeon Master will check for *hazards* (see below). 
### Free Actions
Free "actions" do not impact the *turns* and can be done freely, to an extent. 

- Moving and looking around the current *zone* are free actions.
- Checking doors.

As a rule of thumb, gathering information is free, changing the environment ia an *action*. See The Conversation.
### Marching Order
While moving in narrow hallways, movement is restricted. The marching order is decided by the players. In general, only the *front* and the *back* are significant. 

## Actions
This is a non-exaustive list of the *actions* players might take in a dungeon.
### Move
Move to an adjacent *zone*.
### Run
Move at reckless pace. Move through 6 *zones*. During this, players are *surprised* by all encounters, spring all traps, create *loud* noise, cannot map, and cannot check doors.
### Parlay
Converse with the dungeon denizens. 
#### Reaction roll
The Dungeon Master might ask for a *reaction modifier*. see character p4.

The Dungeon Master might make the roll at advantage or disadvantage, depending on the player’s actions.
A high roll will make the monsters more friendly. A low roll will make them more hostile. A very high or very low roll will also make them *bad* for one *round*. See Dungeon Master p15.
### Conflict
One *conflict* will take one *turn*.
### Search
Searching reveals non-obvious features, such as traps. A search will always reveal everything it can.

Searching will also reclaim one half of ammo.
#### Splitting Up
Seaching a *zone* takes three people one *turn*, or one person two *turn*. 
### Rest
Removes *fatigue*. Ignore the *fatigue hazard* while resting.
### Bandage
Bandages can be used to gain some healing. Make an *intelligence* check. If you succeed, heal the target 1d6, plus a bonus from your wisdom. See *ability scores*. You may bandage yourself.

Bandaging consumes a bandage. Once you are bandaged, you can not be bandaged again until you are *damaged*.

## Hazards
At the end of each *turn*, the Dungeon master will check for *hazards*. 

Differnet enviornments will have different odds, but generally, there's 1-in-6 chance of each hazard. Some areas may have more or less wandering monsters, some areas may have additional *hazards*. etc.

The Dungeon Master should knock on the table to indicate the *turn*.
### Burn
Torches burn out, and lanterns need fresh oil.
### Fatigue
Become *fatigued*. Anyone already *fatigued* takes 1 damage. 
### Shift
Traps reset, doors swing close, and other aspects of the dungeon are triggered.
### Wandering Monsters
In dangerous or unstable areas, monsters may begin hunting you.

## Doors
Doors not held open will swing silently shut during a *shift*.

Magical doors need special conditions to be opened, and can’t be picked, or broken. 
### Checking Doors
Once per *turn*, a player can check a door. 

Each door can only be checked once. 

The Dungeon Master rolls a d6. 
- **Peephole:** If there is a peep hole, or cracks, +2.
- **Class:** If a player has a bonus from their class, add only the strongest bonus. 
- **Results:** A roll of 5 or more will reveal information. Revealing “nothing” or “darkness” is indicative of either a failure, or accurately assessing a dark quiet room
### Failing to open
Attempting to open a stuck, bared, or locked door fails *loudly*. 
### Breaking Doors
Physically destroying a door is an *action*, requires appropriate tools, and makes *loud* noise. 

## Varient Rule: Flashback
Each session, each player may have up to one flashback. The following are provided as suggestions.

In general, anything that could have been done in town can be done as a flashback.
### Purchase
Have gotten a particular item while shopping. 
### Conversation
Role play a brief conversation had before the adventure. 
### Backstory
Role play the origin of a character.
### Preperation
How were you prepared for an unexpected challenge?

## Fleeing the Dungon
Once a party beings to flee the dungeon, they can not stop until they’re out. 

Each *round*, move to an adjacent *zone*, then one character must take 1d4 damage.
