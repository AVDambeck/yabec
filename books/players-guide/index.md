## Alignment
Beneath the surface of everyday life, two primeval forces mingle. Their servants favor either the cosmic order, or the advent of a new one. Some find themselves neutrally or unaligned, choosing for their own ends, or for the end of balance. 
### Magic
Magic affects creatures differently depending on alignment. Divine spellcastes need to be especially aware of their alignment.
### Alignment Language
Creatures automatically recognize a certain set of gestures, signs, and code words, pertaining to their alignment. This allows creatures of common alignment a measure of communication.

Creatures of a different alignment are likely to recognize an alignment language being spoken, but will not understand its content.
### Revealing Alignment
Players must reveal their alignment to the dungeon master, but are not required to reveal to each other. 
### Role Playing Alignment
If the character acts too far out of their alignment, the referee may require them to change their alignment and suffer a penalty.

## Monstrous
Monstrous characters face additional challenges: 

- They are not welcome in urban areas unless accompanied by a human, elf, or dwarf. 
- They can not employ human hirelings. 
- They do not automatically know the common language.
- They have a -2 to reaction rolls with non-monsters.
- When in sunlight, they have a +1 to AC, and AV.
