# Experience
This chapter covers experience points (XP) and how it is awarded. XP is a measure of a PC's power and wealth, and creates progression.

## Score Card
At the start of the session, the Score Keeper will begin a score card: a simple piece of paper to write down *scores* as they happen.

At the end of the session, the Score Keeper will confer with the DM to confirm each *score*, and establish the total amount of XP. 
XP is divided evenly between all surviving characters. The Score Keeper will announce the individual amount gained.
### Prime Requisite
Each class has one or two prime requisites, which grants bonus XP for having a high *ability score*.

Characters with at least a 9 in one prime requisite gain 5% extra XP. 

Characters with at least a 9 in both gain 15% extra XP.

Characters with at least a 16 in one prime requisite gain 15% extra XP.
### Minions
If players are 2nd level or higher, their minions  gain the same amount of XP. 

## Scores
A *score* is anything that awards XP.
### Treasure.
Recovering treasure from a dungeon scores 1 XP per 1 cp value of the treasure.

Recovering a magic item scores 1000 XP.

Recovering a particular quest item scores 1000 XP.
### Goal
Achieving a *goal* scores 100 XP per character involved.  LINK

Failing to achieve a goal reduces the XP from this score card by 100 XP. 
### Defeated Monster 
Defeating monsters scores XP based on their HD, plus a bonus for each special ability. e.g. a 2+2 HD monster with an ability is worth 35 XP.

| HD	    | Base	| Bonus |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| <1        | 5	    | 1     |
| 1	        | 10	| 3     |
| 1+        | 15	| 4     |
| 2	        | 20	| 5     |
| 2+        | 25	| 10    |
| 3         | 35	| 15    |
| 3+        | 50	| 25    |
| 4	        | 75	| 50    |
| 4+        | 125	| 75    |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 5, 5+     | 200	| 150   |
| 6, 6+, 7  | 300	| 250   |
| 7+, 8, 8+ | 650	| 550   |
| ≥9        | 1000	| 700   |
### Mapping
Correctly mapping a complete dungeon level scores XP equal to 1000 times the depth of the level.

## Extra Sources of XP
### Session Report
Writing a session report awarsds 100 XP to the writer. 
### Roles
Having a role grains XP. See Roles.
### Punch Card
On a player's tenth session, they get 1000 XP.
### Specials
From time to time, the Dungeon Master might offer additional bonuses. For example, for writing lore about NPCs. 

## Leveling Up
When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player:

- Looks at the character’s class and notes any improvements in saving throws, AV, spells, etc. 
- Roll your HD and add it to your HP.
- Gain an additional *week* of *downtime*. 
- Increase two different *ability scores* by 1, to a maximum of 18.

### One Session Maximum
Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Leave the character 1 XP below the threshold for the next level. The remaining XP can be distributed among the other characters, as the player wishes. If all characters are 1 XP below the threshold, extra XP is wasted.
