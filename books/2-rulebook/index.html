<p>This book is a point by point breakdown of every aspect of the game system. It is not the player's requirement to read the player's reference. New players only need read the <em>essential</em> pages of the guide book. All players are welcome and encouraged to read the rule book in order to gain a better understanding of the game, but only at their leisure and interest.</p>
<p>The Dungeon Master should know the rules well enough to run and teach them. </p>
<h3>Modification</h3>
<p>The book is meant to act as a standard reference for how the Dungeon Master makes rulings. While the Dungeon Master's call is ultimently final, its recommended to stick to the book, and later change unsatisfactory rules. Yabec is open source, and available on Github.</p>
<p>If players don't like the rules, they should begin a conversation about how they would like the rule, and the kind of game they are interested in playing. When an agreement is made, it should be reflected in the book. If they have other games they are interested in playing, they should also bring those to the conversation. /gen</p>
<p>The book also acts as a suggest stock of rulings. If the Dungeon Master should be able to appeal to the book, and get a simple but opinionated rule. The new rule should not disrupt the flow of play, but rather maintain it. If the rule turns unfun, it should be ammended via the above process.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>The Conversation</h3>
<p>You may be familitar with this concept from other ttrpgs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the Dungeon Master. </p>
<ol>
<li>The Dungeon Master begins by describing a sitchuation. </li>
<li>Players ask questions to gain information about the enviornment. </li>
<li>Eventually, the players choose to undertake some action. The Dungeon Master will describe the consequences of the action, sometimes taking specific die rolls into consideration. </li>
<li>This becomes the new sitchuation, and the loop begins again.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Hooks</h3>
<p>Some actions are <em>actions</em>. The italics indicate that this is a <em>hook</em>, a keyword with in the rules, with specific consequences. </p>
<p>Yabec is designed around chains of <em>hooks</em>. For example, in <em>conflict</em>, the game is played in <em>rounds</em>, which during each you get one <em>action</em>, which you use to <em>attack</em>, and then when all <em>combatants</em> have acted, a new <em>round</em> begins, and so on...</p>
<h2>Player Roles</h2>
<p>There are several optional <em>roles</em> that players can have. Using <em>roles</em> makes play smoother and easier for the Dungeon Master. Use a notecard or token to keep track of <em>roles</em>. </p>
<p>In addition to potentially being a <em>score</em> for the party, taking on a <em>role</em> during <em>town</em> scores awards 50 XP to that character. 100 XP for Callers and Mappers.</p>
<p>If a player with a <em>role</em> dies, another player may take on that <em>role</em>. </p>
<p>Its possible to have multipule of most <em>roles</em>. For example, there can be a Caller for delving and a Caller for combat, or two Mappers that check eachother's work.</p>
<h3>Chair</h3>
<p>Make sure roles are filled. Go through each role, ask for volunteers.</p>
<h3>Score Keeper</h3>
<p>Keep track of <em>scores</em>, such as looted treasure, and defeated monsters. See experience.</p>
<h3>Quater Master</h3>
<p><em>Chart</em> the path to the dungeon while in <em>town</em>, and keep track of torches, bandages, and other equipment.</p>
<h3>Mapper</h3>
<p>Keep track of the layout of the dungeon. If you'd like, ask the Dungeon Master for exact <em>map calls</em>. See mapping.</p>
<h3>Caller</h3>
<p>Get consensus on what the party would like to do, and communicate to the Dungeon Master.</p>
<h3>Scribe</h3>
<p>Keep track of the different monsters and traps, their behaviors, mechanics, and even their combat statistics (depending on the Dungeon Master's approach to metagaming).</p>
<h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
<h3>Advantage</h3>
<p>When making a roll with <em>advantage</em>, roll an additional time for each <em>advantage</em>. Take the best roll.</p>
<p>During a <em>challenge</em>, count every <em>success</em> on an <em>ability check</em> with <em>advantage</em>.</p>
<h3>Disadvantage</h3>
<p>When making a roll with <em>disadvantage</em>, roll twice and take the worse.</p>
<h3>Combination.</h3>
<p>One <em>disadvantage</em> and <em>advantage</em> cancel eachother out.</p>
<h2>Miscellenious</h2>
<h3>Rounding</h3>
<p>When not otherwise specified, round down.</p>
<h3>Ties</h3>
<p>Where not otherwise mentioned, favor the players.</p>
<h3>Weak and Strong Monsters</h3>
<p>Monster with 4 HD or more are <em>powerful</em>. Monsters with 3HD or less are <em>ordinary</em>.</p>
<h3>Merit</h3>
<p>Some Downtime activities grant <em>merit</em>. When begining a <em>delve</em>, a charater’s <em>merit</em> (if any) is reduced to their level.</p>
<h3>Boons</h3>
<p><em>Boons</em> are enchantments that attach to ones aura. A <em>boon</em> occupies an item <em>slot</em>, but can not be transferred nor stored. <em>Boons</em> can be bought with <em>Merit</em>, while preforming certain Downtime activities. </p>
<p>Once a <em>boon</em> is used, it is destroyed. </p>
<p>A <em>boon</em> can be discarded at anytime.</p>
<h2>Metagaming</h2>
<p>I have a lax approach to metagaming. Any info gained during the session is valid, including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Info from dead characters.</li>
<li>Deduced AC and Hit Dice.</li>
</ul></body></html>
