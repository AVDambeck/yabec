### Shopping
Every town will have the *basic* items availble. Some towns may have additional shops. Ask your Dungeon Master.
### Downtime
The first time in *town* per session, returning characters get one *downtime*. See Extended.

Characters who owe *service* must preform it before puruing other options.
### Travel
End the *scheme* and go to a dungeon. See below.
### Goals
Set goals to potentially *score* more XP. See below.

## Travel 
The Dungeon Master will present an overworld map with one or more dugeons, an possibly other towns. 
### Deciding a destination
Any player can contribute to the discussion of what dungeon to go to. However, only one player needs to *chart* the journey. 

Unopinionated players can simply follow the party to whichever dungeon they go to.
### Charting
1. Count the number of hexes between the party's current location, and the destination. 
2. If the destination is a dungeon, add the number of hexes back to a town.
3. If any, add the number of rivers and other obstivles. 
4. For each player and minion, aquire a ration for each hex. 
5. (optional) If crossing a body of water, also aquire the fare for passage on a boat.

Best practice is to have each participating player compensate the *quarter master* for their rations.
### Departing
One player, ideally the Caller will announce "Adventuers to depart!". 

Once all players have confirmed they are ready to *depart*, the players travel to their destination. 

If it is a dungeon, change the *scheme* to *dungeon*.

If it is a different town, simply continue *town* in the new location.

## Goals
Each session, the players may agree to set one goal for the party. If the goal has already been completed in the past, or is not difficult enough, the Dungeon Master may reject it.

Completing a goal is a *score*. See Experience.
### Examples 
- Kill a the bear with the scarred eye.
- No character deaths.
- Get to the third level of the dungeon.
- Rescue a particular prisoner.
- Recover a particular treasure.
