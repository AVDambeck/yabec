# Conflict
Short burst of turn based combat; also covers chases.

## Inititative
The Dungeon Master can employ either of these two methods for initiative.
### Dramatic
Each *round*, each combatant can take one *action*. Then they must wait for the next *round* to *act* again.

Players choose the order they and their minions go in. However, after each of their *actions*, an enemy will *act*. 
### Ranked
At the start of *conflict*, each player rolls a d10 and adds their *dexterity* score. This is their *count*. *Ordinary* monsters have *count* 13. *Powerful* monsters have *count* 21. Minions have a *count* equal to their boss.

At the start of each *round*, the creature with the highest *count* takes one *action*. Then proceed in decending order.

Ties between the players can be resolved in either order they please. Players win ties against monsters.

## Actions
### Attack
Make an *attack* with a weapon. See below.
### Magic
Cast a spell or use a magic item. See Magic.
### Move
Move to an adjacent *zone*. 
### Sprint
*Move* twice. Make a *constitution check*. If you fail, you are *bad* during the next *round*.
### Focus
Until the end of the next *round*, you have *advantage* on *dodges*, *saves*, *attacks*, and *checks*.
### Stunts
Other maneuvers are stunts. How they are resolved is up to the Dungeon Master. 

Stunts may not cause damage directly.
#### Suggestions
**Shove:** a *hit* has a 3-in-6 chance of moving an enemy to an adjacent *zone*.
**Intimidation:** with a successful *charisma check*, force enemies to make a *moral check*.
**Disarm:** a *hit* grants a *dexterity check* to disarm an enemy. 
**Sunder:** a *hit* deals one damage to the weapon or armor.
### Flee
If you have not been *hit* this *round*, you begin *fleeing*: *Move*, you are no longer in *conflict*.

## Attacking
### Statistics
The Armor Class (AC) is how likely a target is to be hit. 

The Attack Value (AV), also called THAC0, is how likely an attack is to miss.

Lower AC and AV are better.

The Dungeon Master might either announce the result of the *attack*, or tell you the AC/AV so you can announce it yourself.
### Making an Attack
To *attack*, subtract a d20 from you AV. If it is greater than or equal to the AC, you *hit*. Otherwise, you *miss*.
### Dodging an Attack
To dodge an attack, roll a d20 and add your AC. If it is less than or equal to the AV, the attack is a *miss*. Otherwise, it is a *hit*

## Miscellanious
### Flanking
In melee, if one side surrounds the other, the surounded side has a +4 penalty to AC. 
### Friendly Fire
When a ranged attack *misses*, players make a *dexterity check* to void hitting an ally. Monsters and minons have a 3-in-6 chance.
### En Passant
The first time each *turn* that a combatant takes a *move* action, they may also make an *attack*
### Subdual
If a creature is *slain* with a blunt weapon, they can be left non-leathally incapacitated, and *bad* until a *shift*.
### Mapping
During conflict, it's possible to reference a map, but adding to a map is impossible. The dungeon master will not make *map calls*. See page X
### Movement
While not *bad*, each combatant can move freely within a *zone*. Changing *zones* takes an *action*.
### Exaustion
At the end of the 9th round, and each round after, all creatures still involved in the combat take 1 damage.
