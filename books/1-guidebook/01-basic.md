### Turn Undead
Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters. To turn the undead, roll 2d6. The Dungeon Master can either tell you the HD of the monster, or consults the table themselves.

If the result is equal to or greater than the number in the table, the monster is turned. At higher levels, some undead may be automatically **T**urned, or **D**estroyed.

#### Restrictions
**Excess:** Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are wasted.

**Minimum effect:** At least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.

**Mixed groups:** If the undead are of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

**Recharge:** A cleric can attempt to turn only once per *turn*.

#### Successful Turning
If the turning attempt succeeds, roll 2d6 again to determine the number of undead affected.

Turned undead will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or make contact with the Cleric.

### Divine Magic
See Magic for full details.

**Holy symbol:** A cleric must carry a holy symbol to use magic.

**Deity disfavor:** Clerics must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and religion. Tenets for all clerics include:

- Only using blunt weapons.
- Refusal to buy, sell, or use poisons, including alcohol. 
- 10% tithe to the temple.
- Respect of all royalty. 

**Spell casting:** Once a cleric has proven their faith (from 2nd level), the character may pray to receive spells. The power and number of spells available to a cleric are determined by the character’s level. Their spell list is found on Magic page 9.

### After Reaching 9th Level
A cleric may establish or build a stronghold. So long as the cleric is currently in favor with their god, a stronghold may be bought or built at half the normal price, due to the aid of the faithful. 

Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers (5d6 × 10 fighters of level 1–2). These troops are completely devoted to the cleric, having a loyalty of 12. The referee decides which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.

### Thieves Cant
Thieves know a general code of conduct, including unique gestures, signs, and code words. This language allows them to communicate, while sounding like innocent small talk to the unfamiliar. 

### Thief Skills
Thieves are highly talented, and capable of many skills. See the skill progression table opposite.

- **Climb sheer surfaces (CS):** A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage. (1d6 per 10’)
- **Check Doors (CD):** A thief gets a bonus to check doors See Adventure, page 9.
- **Stealth Bonus:** The thief gets a bonus to *stealth*.
- **Open locks (OL):** Requires thieves’ tools. A thief can only try this skill once per lock. If the roll fails, the thief may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.
- **Pick pockets (PP):** If the victim is 4 HD or greater, the thief ’s roll is penalized by 5% for every HD more than 4. There is always at least a 1% chance of failure. A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means that the attempted theft is noticed. 

Checking skills with a percent chance: roll d%. If it is the listed value or less, the skill succeeds.

#### Back-Stab
Wen attacking a *bad* opponet, a Thief deals triple damage. 

### Read Languages
A thief of 4th level or higher can decipher critical portions of non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular text again before gaining an experience level.

#### Scroll Use
A thief of 10th level or higher can cast arcane spells from scrolls. There is a 10% chance of error: the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual or deleterious effect.

### After Reaching 9th Level
A thief can establish a thief den, attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. These thieves will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the PC will not be able to attract apprentices to replace them. A successful thief might use these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.
