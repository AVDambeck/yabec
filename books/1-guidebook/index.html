<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p>Beneath the surface of everyday life, two primeval forces mingle. Their servants favor either the cosmic order, or the advent of a new one. Some find themselves neutrally or unaligned, choosing for their own ends, or for the end of balance. </p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Magic affects creatures differently depending on alignment. Divine spellcastes need to be especially aware of their alignment.</p>
<h3>Alignment Language</h3>
<p>Creatures automatically recognize a certain set of gestures, signs, and code words, pertaining to their alignment. This allows creatures of common alignment a measure of communication.</p>
<p>Creatures of a different alignment are likely to recognize an alignment language being spoken, but will not understand its content.</p>
<h3>Revealing Alignment</h3>
<p>Players must reveal their alignment to the dungeon master, but are not required to reveal to each other. </p>
<h3>Role Playing Alignment</h3>
<p>If the character acts too far out of their alignment, the referee may require them to change their alignment and suffer a penalty.</p>
<h2>Monstrous</h2>
<p>Monstrous characters face additional challenges: </p>
<ul>
<li>They are not welcome in urban areas unless accompanied by a human, elf, or dwarf. </li>
<li>They can not employ human hirelings. </li>
<li>They do not automatically know the common language.</li>
<li>They have a -2 to reaction rolls with non-monsters.</li>
<li>When in sunlight, they have a +1 to AC, and AV.</li>
</ul></body></html>
