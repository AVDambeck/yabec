## Acrobat Skills
Choose two acrobat skills. Each time you level up, choose another. The odds of the skill suceeding is shown on the skill progression table.

- **Climb sheer surfaces (CS):** A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the acrobat falls at the halfway point, suffering fall damage. (1d6 per 10’)
- **Falling (FA):** When able to tumble, suffer no damage from the first 10’ of any fall. Further damage is reduced by the listed percentage.
- **Catch Missiles (CM):** Once per turn, attempt to can catch a non-magical projectile. 
- **Tightrope walking (TW):** Acrobats can walk tightropes, narrow beams, and ledges. Failure indicates that the acrobat falls. A balance pole increases the chance by 10%.
- **Evasion:** When you succeed a *saving throw*, take no damage instead of half. Take half damage instead of full on a failed save.
- **Nimble:** During *combat*, *attack* and *move* in one *action*.
- **Running Vault (RV):** With a 20’ run-up and a pole, jump this long, and half as high. 
- **Quick movement (QM):** During *conflict*, *move* two *zones*. Use a limited number of times per *turn*.
