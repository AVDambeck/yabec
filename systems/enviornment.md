# Enviornment
This chapter covers how to track light, distance, and similar elements.

## Time
Time is measured in three units. How long these units are is upto the DM.

### Turn
Most adventuring activities, such as having a fight or searching a room take one *turn*. Each *turn*, the DM checks for hazards. 

### Round
A *round* is a short unit of time used during conflict. There are 10 *rounds* in one *turn*.

### Week
Each session, players get one *week's* worth of downtime. 

## Distance
There are three units of distance. 

### Step
PLACEHOLDER

A *step* is an abstract measure of distance. Moving from a hallway to a room, or vice versa, is five *steps* under typical conditions.

1. Moving to a door.
2. Crossing a threshold.
3. Moving down the hallway.
4. Moving further down the hallway. 
5. Crossing a threshold.

The following are also one *step*:

- Traversistairs or a ladder.
- Traversing a simple obstacle.
- Traversing between two *zones*, in a large area.
- Traveling about 2 squares.

### Squares
The exact number of map squares can be counted to determine more exact distance. This is especially helpful if playing on a large battle map.

### Feet
Rarely, distance will be measured in feet, especially in spell descriptions.

## Zones
Ranges and relative location are divided into four *zones*.

### Touch 
Touching distance. In the same square.

### Close
Throwing distance. Speaking distance. About 1 step. About 2 squares. 

### Distant
Shouting distance. Farthest distance to make out details (in *bright* light). Bow distance. About 5 steps. About 10 squares.

In dark environments, the player's torch will often be the limit of theire sight. This means that anything within torch light is *distant.*

### Sight
Anything that can be seen. Up to 3 miles in ideal conditions.

## Noise
The are kinds of noise: 

### Silent
Produces effectivly no sound; no effect.

### Loud
Heard by **distant** listeners. Increases the chance of wandering monsters. Etc.

Most sounds are *loud* by default.

A *loud* sound can be made *silent* with *stealth*.

## Light
### Levels
There are three types of light:

#### Dark
The darkness is pitch black, and prevents sight. Imposess blindness.

#### Dim
Allows some detail to be seen.

#### Bright
Allows full vision, including details and reading. Disables *infravision*.

### Light Power
A light source casts for a number of steps equal to its light power (or four times that many squares). Half of that light is *bright* and half of it is *dim*. 

| Source  | Power |
|-------- |-------|
| Candle  | 1/2   |
| Langern | 1     |
| Magic   | 2     |
| Torch   | 2     |

### Burn
When the DM announces *burn*, torches burn out, and lanterns need new oil. 

### Blindness
Creatures who are unable to perceive their surroundings are *bad*.

### Infravision
A special type of vision had by many monsters: seeing heat energy that radiats of living things. 

When a creature with *infrabision* stands in *bright*, they are blinded for one round, and their *infravison* is disabled until they spend a full *turn* in the *dark*.

It is not possible to read in the *dim* or *dark* with *infravision*. 

## Bad
*Bad* is a generalized status conditions. 

*Attacks* and *stealth* against *bad* targets always succeed. 

*Bad* creatures can:
- Hear.
- Speak.
- *Save*.
- Desperate actions allowed by *badness*. For example, move randomly in the dark, or move inches while bound.  

*Bad* cretures can not:
- Move.
- *Attack*.
- Cast spells.
- Use magic items.
- Use class skills.
