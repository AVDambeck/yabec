## Basic Character Creation
Choose one of the premade character playbooks.

Reccomended for first time players.

## Manual Character Creation
Get a sheet of paper, or print out a character sheet, to record all of your cracter's details.

### Ability Scores
Choose either one of these arrays, and assign them however you like to the six stats *strength*, *dexterity*, *constitution*, *intelligence*, *wisdom*, and *charisma*.

- 13, 13, 11, 11, 9, 9
- 16, 13, 10, 8, 6, 5

#### Optional: Rolling ability scores. 
If you wish, you can instead roll 3d6 six times to create a new array.

### Choose a Class
There are many classes to choose from. Make sure you meet the requirements for that class.

Unless you choose a Demihuman class, you are a human.

### Determine Statistics
Make sure you have the page for your chosen class available.

- Your HP (health points) is equal to the maximum value of your class's Health Die.
- Your AV (attack value) is on your class's progression table.
- Your saving throws are on your class's progression table.  
- Note class abilities, and choose spells. 
- Note the bonuses, or penalties, from your ability scores. See page X.

### Choose Alignment  
Choose whether you are  Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. See p5.

### Note XP and Level
Characters start at 1st level with 0 xp.

### Money

## Alignment
Beneath the surface of everyday life, two primeval forces mingle. Their servants favor either the cosmic order, or the advent of a new one. Some find themselves neutrally or unaligned, choosing for their own ends, or for the end of balance. 
### Magic
Magic affects creatures differently depending on alignment. Divine spellcastes need to be especially aware of their alignment.
### Alignment Language
Creatures automatically recognize a certain set of gestures, signs, and code words, pertaining to their alignment. This allows creatures of common alignment a measure of communication.
Creatures of a different alignment are likely to recognize an alignment language being spoken, but will not understand its content.
### Revealing Alignment
Players must reveal their alignment to the dungeon master, but are not required to reveal to each other. 
### Role Playing Alignment
If the character acts too far out of their alignment, the referee may require them to change their alignment and suffer a penalty.

## Monstrous
Monstrous characters face additional challenges: 
- They are not welcome in urban areas unless accompanied by a human, elf, or dwarf. 
- They can not employ human hirelings. 
- They do not automatically know the common language.
- They have a -2 to reaction rolls with non-monsters.
- When in sunlight, they have a +1 to AC, and AV.
