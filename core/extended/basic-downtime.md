Roll D%. If it is less than or equal to 60 minus three times the level of the desired mentor, you find a mentor. Give them a name, and some details, and tell your Dungeon Master. 

Now that you have established contact, you can hire them in the future for a cost of 200 cp per level, except for Clerics who instead accept 1 *week* of service. After each hire, there is a 1-in-10 chance you loose contact with them.

Spellcasters have a 1-in-6 chance of knowing any particular spell. 

If you fail to find a mentor, you gain 1d4 *merit*.

More adventuring!

Choose a challenge to face. Each round, you’ll make a melee attack against it, and then it will make a melee attack against you. You can flee at anytime. 

Multipule characters can team up. Each character gets to make an attack, and the challange will make only one attack, chooseing a target at random.

## Selling 
Try to get a better buy on your treasure.

Each week, you can find buyers for treasure equal to 100 cp times your level. If a single object is more valuable than that, you must work for several *weeks* to sell it.

*True Merchant*: For each 1 *merit* spent, sell an additional 10% (compounding).

### Sale
When you sell the item, roll d% on the table, and add your *charisma* score. 

| d% | Sale |
| <20 | Robbed! 0% |
| 20-29 | Low ball: 75% |
| 30-39 | Low ball: 90% |
| 40-89 | 110% | 
| 90-100 | 140% |
| >100 | Swindler! 200% |

If you get a low ball, you can refuse to sell.

If you get robbed, ask your Dungeon Master for a lead on the thieves.

### Tax
There is a 1% tax on sales over 500 cp.

## Service
"Volunteer" at the temple.

Service is often done in payment for crimes, or to restore favor of a diety. 

The first time you preform service, you gain no benifit. The second time, you gain one *merit*. The third and further times, you gain three *merit*, and can buy one boon, depending on your alignment.

### Lawful 
- *Unboon*: gain an additional 1d4-1 *merit*.
- *True Citizanship*: Costs 1 *merit*. Reduce the estate tax to 5%, for a character who died in the previous session, or wave any one tax this session.
- *True Service*: Costs 4 *merit* Using this *boon* counts as a *week* of service.
- *Healing*: Costs 1 *merit*. Heal 2d6.

### Any Alignment
- *Clergy*: costs 10 *merit*. From now on, you can preform embezzlement as a downtime activity.
- *True Learning*: Costs 6 *merit*. Increase the XP from one *delve* by 50%. Does not stack.
- *True Agreement*: Costs 5 *merit*. Call in a favor with temple leadership.
- *True Valor:* Costs 3 *Merit*. When an *touch* ally is attacked, redirect it to yourself. 
- *True Ability*: Costs 20 Merit. When you succeed an ability check, other than *constitution*, increase that that score by one, to a maximum of 16.

### Chaotic
- Instead of buying a *boon*, you cna pay 50 cp to have a goon do your service for you. Spend a *week* of downtime elsewhere.
- *True Accounting*: Costs 5 *merit*. Aquire 50% of the estate tax of a character that died last session, or 100% of the estate tax of a character that died this session.
- *True Law*: Costs 6 *merit*. Reroll a *risk* on another character's crime. See advanced downtime.
- *True Pain*: Costs 10 *Merit*. Instead of rolling, deal the maximum amount of damage on one weapon damage roll.

## Taming
Mundane animals can be tamed by anyone. 
Druids, and Elves, can tame magical animals, and tame mundane animals twice as fast.

Choose the type of animal you want to find. It must be an animal common in the area your located in. You can also choose an animal you have already made progress with, or a rare animal you know the location of.

Each week, make two *charisma* checks, (Druids and Elves make four). For each you succeed, you gain one favor with the animal. 

Once you gain a favor equal to 5 plus the HD of the animal, the animal becomes tamed. Then you can begin training it.

Each of the following skills costs a certain amount of favor:

| Skill | Favor | 
|:---|---|
| Bravory | 2 | 
| Attacking | 5 | 
| Ridable | 1 |
| Guarding | 3 | 
| Tracking | 3 | 

## team-building
Spend the week attending leadership seminars, and making topped flat bread to enjoy with your or your friend’s minions. 

Costs 10 cp per minion. Each participating minion has a 2-in-6 chance of gaining 1 loyalty, to a maximum of 8. 

### Boons
Each minion that gains loyalty yields 1 *merit*.

*True Loyalty*: Costs 5 *merit*. One loyalty check automatically succeeds.

*True Valor*: Costs 3 merit. When a *touch* ally is attacked redirect it to yourself.

## Training 
While you were carousing, I studied the blade. 

In order to train, you must hire a mentor of the same class but a higher level. See finding a mentor. 

For each additional 10 cp you spend, gain 1d20 xp.

For an additional 5 cp per minion, up to three minions of the same class can train with you, and gain half the XP that you do.
