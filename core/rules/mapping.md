# Mapping
Dungeons are complex enviornments where it is easy to get lost. Keeping a map is essential. 

This chapter covers simple and detailed methods of mapping. It is a simple system not able to cover every possible map, so you may have to get creative. 

Additionally, you may wish to modify the system to better suit your needs. Any agreed upon system will work.

Its reccomended that one player take on the role of Mapper. See Roles.

## Simple Method
Rather than track the exact dimensions of every room, the mapper might opt to keep a general shape of the dungeon.

The mapper draws a loose flow chart, labeling rooms and their connections.

## Calls
To keep an exact map, the mapper should ask the Dungeon Master for a call. 

Each call should have an unambiguous meaning. The mapper and Dungeon Master should work together to establish calls that work for them.

The Dungeon Master should avoid looking at the players map, and avoid perfecting the players map. 
### Restrictions
The Dungeon Master will only provide calls when the players ask, and only after they enter a room and are able to spend time observing it. 

If the players loose their compass, calls will not include cardinal directions.

## Corridor Calls
Except for hallway, each of these calls indicate exactly one square.
### Hallway
**Hallway, number, direction:** Indicates the corridor goes straight for a number of squares in that direction.
**Draw:** Two straight lines.
PICTURE
Hallway 3 west.
### Turn
**turn, direction:** Indicates a square where the corridor turns in the direction
**Draw:** A dot + an L shape.
PICTURE
Left: turn east.

Right: Hallway 1 north. AND Turn west. 
### Split
**Split, (directions):** indicates the corridor slits left and right.
**Draw:** Line + two dots.
PICTURE
Left: split.

Right: hallway 1 north. AND Split.
### Cross
**Cross:** indicates a square with four openings. 
**Draw:** Four dots
PICTURE
### Branch
**Branch, direction:** Indicates the corridor has an opening on the side or direction indicated. 
**Draw:** Line + two dots.
PICTURE
Hallway 1 east. AND Branch south. AND Hallway 1 east.
### Terminate
**Terminate:** Indicates the end of a corridor. 
**Draw:** Three sided U.
PICTURE
Terminate.
### Large Corridors
Large corridors can ban called in the same manor, but scaled to be twice as big, thrice as big, etc.

## Room Calls
### Rectangular
Designate a door as the entrance. Call how far the wall extends to each side. Then describe the depth of the room.
PICTURE
Room: 1 north, 2 south, 3 deep.
### Wall trace
From the entrance, going clockwise, call the direction and length of wall segment. 
PICTURE
Room, wall trace: north east 1, east 2, south 2, west 1, south 1, east 2, south 1, south west 1, west 2, north east 2, east 1, north 1
### Large rooms
Large rooms, such as caverns, can be called by an extension of the wall trace method. A wall on each side can be traced, bit by bit.
### Irregular Caverns
Irregular caverns can be called by describing the general path of the cavern and width of the cavern, similar to wall trace. 

## Doors / Exits
### Definition
Doors are hinged panels. Exits are open passageways.

Call them after calling a rooms or corridors.
### Calling
On each wall, count squares from east to west, north to south (reading direction), naming the number of the squares, and whether there is a door or an exit. 

You can also call the center, or last square. 
**Draw:** Pictogram
PICTURE
Doors: East wall 2nd & 4th squares. South wall center.

Exit, west wall 2nd square.
### Stairs
Stairs, and a direction (up or down), indicate a square filled with stairs. The stairs extend away from the previous call. 
**Draw:** Pictogram.
PICTURE
Left: Stairs going up.

Right: Stairs going down.
