# Enviornment
This chapter covers how to track light, distance, and similar elements.

## Time
Time is measured in three units. 
### Turn
Most adventuring activities, such as having a fight or searching a room take one *turn*. 
### Round
A *round* is a short unit of time used during conflict. There are 10 *rounds* in one *turn*.
### Week
Each session, players get one *week's* worth of downtime. 

## Zones
The dungeon enviornment is split into *zones*. As a rule of thumb, each room and hallway is a *zone*. Large rooms or hallways may be multipule *zone*

## Ranges
Ranges and relative location are divided into four *ranges*.
### Touch 
Striking distance. 
### Close
Throwing distance. Speaking distance. With in the same *zone*.
### Distant
Shouting distance. Farthest distance to make out details (in *bright* light). 
In dark environments, the player's torch will often be the limit of theire sight. This means that anything within torch light is *distant.*
### Sight
Anything that can be seen. Up to 3 miles in ideal conditions.

## Noises
The are two kinds of noise: 
### Silent
Produces effectivly no sound; no effect.
### Loud
Heard by *distant* listeners. Increases the chance of wandering monsters. Etc.
Most sounds are *loud* by default.
A *loud* sound can be made *silent* with *stealth*.

## Light
### Levels
There are three kinds of light:
#### Dark
The *darkness* is pitch black, and prevents sight. Imposess blindness.
#### Dim
Allows some detail to be seen.
#### Bright
Allows full vision, including details and reading. Disables *infravision*.
### Distant
A light source casts *bright* light within *touch*, and *dim* within *distant*. 
### Infravision
A special type of vision had by many monsters: seeing heat energy that radiats of living things. 
When a creature with *infravision* stands in *bright*, they are blinded for one round, and their *infravison* is disabled until they spend a full *turn* in the *dark*.
It is not possible to read in the *dim* or *dark* with *infravision*. 
### Blindness
Creatures who are unable to perceive their surroundings are *bad*.
