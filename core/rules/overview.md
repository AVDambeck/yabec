# Overview

## The Conversation
You may be familitar with this concept from other ttrpgs. The game is essentially a back and forth between the players and the Dungeon Master. 

## Hooks
Yabec is designed around a series of *hooks*. *Hooks* are keywords shown in italics. They're designed to link naturally into eachother.
For example, on a *turn*, you get one *action*, which you use to *attack*. This results in either a *hit* or a *miss*. A *hit* can cause damage or a spell effect. Then the *turn* ends, and causes a *hazard*, such as *fatigue*, which might end a spell effect.

## Scheme
There are four *schemes*. Each has its own chapter.
### Town
Players navigate an urban setting, often splitting up to do *downtime*, or go shopping. The *scheme* ends when the players *depart* on an *adventure*.
### Delve
Players explore a dangerous dungeon. This *scheme* ends when the players leave the dungeon. Then *clean up*.
### Conflict
Players fight or flee from monsters. This *scheme* occers within a *delve*, or rarely, in a *town*.
### Clean Up 
Handle experience, splitting treasure, and other loose ends. Either end the session here, or begin *town* again.

## Player Roles
There are several roles that players are encouraged to take on. Use a notecard or token to keep track of roles. Taking on a role grants a small XP bonus.
### Chair
Once per session, either the Dungeon Master or a player can call "Open the adventure's council". That person is the *chair*. They will go some or all of the roles, asking for volunteers, or resolving conflicts.
