# Conflic

## Basic
### Time
One *conflict* takes one dungeon *turn*. Time within *conflict* measured in rounds.
#### Exaustin
At the end of the 6th round, and each round after, all creatures still involved in the combat take 1 damage.
### Mapping
During conflict, it's possible to reference a map, but adding to a map is impossible. The dungeon master will not make *map calls*. See page X
### Movement
While not *bad*, each combatant can move freely within a *zone*. Changing *zones* takes an *action*.


## Inititative
The Dungeon Master can employ either of these two methods for initiative.

### Dramatic
Each round, each combatant can take one *action*. Then they must wait for the next round to act again.

Players can go in any order they choose. After each player's action, an enemy take an action. However, if the player is *bad*, the enemy will go before the player instead.

### Ranked
at the start of *conflict*, each player rolls a d10 and adds their *dexterity* score. this is their *count*. *Ordinary* monsters have *count* 13. *Powerful* monsters have *count* 18. 

At the start of each *round*, the creature with the highest *count* takes one *action*. then proceed in decending order.

Ties between the players can be resolved in either order they please. players win ties against monsters, unless they are *bad*.

## bad
*bad* is a generalized status conditions. 

*attacks* and *stealth* against *bad* targets always succeed. 

*bad* creatures can:
- hear.
- speak.
- *Save*.
- Desperate actions allowed by *badness*. For example, move randomly in the dark, or move inches while bound.  

*Bad* cretures can not:
- Move. 
- *Attack*.
- Cast spells.
- Use magic items.
- Use class skills.

Depending on the exact condition, *Bad* creatures might be able to take some limited action. For example, a blind creature may beable to move randomly, or a bound character might work to break out of their restraints.


## Actions
### Attack
Make an *attack* with a weapon. See page X.

### Magic
Cast a spell or use a magic item. See Magic.

### Move
Move to an adjacent *zone*. See page X.

#### Sprint
*Move* twice. During the next round, you are *bad*.

#### Retreat
*Move*. You are now in-retreat:
- -2 AC bonus.
- *Attack* with *disadvantage*.
- Can not cast spells.
- If you do not *move* for a *round*, your retreat ends, and you are *bad* for one *round*.

### Flee
If three or more *attacks* have *missed* you since last you took an *action* other than *move*, you escape the *conflict*.

### Stunts
Other maneuvers are stunts. How they are resolved is up to the Dungeon Master. 

Stunts may not cause damage directly.

#### Suggestions
**Forced move:** a *hit* has a 3-in-6 chance of moving an enemy to an adjacent zone.
**Intimidation:** with a successful charisma check, its force enemies to make a moral check.
**Disarming:** a *hit* grants a dexterity check to disarm an enemy. 
**Sundering:** a *hit* deals one damage to the weapon or armor.

## Attacking
### Statistics
The Armor Class (AC) is how likely a target is to be hit. 

The Attack Value (AV), also called THAC0, is how likely an attack is to miss.

Lower AC and AV are better.

The Dungeon Master might either announce the result of the *attack*, or tell you the AC/AV so you can announce it yourself.

### Making an Attack
To make an *attack*, subtract a d20 from you AV. If it is greater than or equal to the AC, you *hit*. Otherwise, you *miss*.

### Dodging an Attack
To dodge an attack, roll a d20 and add your AC. if it is less than or equal to the AV, the attack is a *miss*. Otherwise, it is a *hit*

## Appendix

### Flanking
In melee, if one side surrounds the other, the surounded side has a +4 penalty to AC. 

### Friendly Fire
A missed ranged attack has a 3-in-6 chance to hit an ally engaged in melee.

### En Passant
The first time each *turn* that a combatant takes a *move* action, they may also make an *attack*
