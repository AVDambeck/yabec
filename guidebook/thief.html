<h3>Thieves Cant</h3>
<p>Thieves know a general code of conduct, including unique gestures, signs, and code words. This language allows them to communicate, while sounding like innocent small talk to the unfamiliar. </p>
<h3>Stealth</h3>
<p>Thieves have <em>advantage</em> on <em>checks</em> made to sneak and decieve. 
<h3>Thief Skills</h3>
<p>Thieves are highly talented, and capable of many skills. See the skill progression table opposite.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climb sheer surfaces (CS):</strong> A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage. (1d6 per 10’)</li>
<li><strong>Check Doors (CD):</strong> A thief gets a bonus to check doors See Adventure, page 9.</li>
<li><strong>Open locks (OL):</strong> Requires thieves’ tools. A thief can only try this skill once per lock. If the roll fails, the thief may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking skills with a percent chance: roll d%. If it is the listed value or less, the skill succeeds. </p>

<h4>Back-Stab</h4>
<p>When attacking a <em>bad</em> opponet, a Thief deals double damage. Thievs of 6th level or higher deal triple damage.</p>
<h3>Read Languages</h3>
<p>A thief of 4th level or higher can decipher critical portions of non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular text again before gaining an experience level.</p>
<h4>Scroll Use</h4>
<p>A thief of 10th level or higher can cast arcane spells from scrolls. There is a 10% chance of error: the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual or deleterious effect.</p>
<h3>After Reaching 9th Level</h3>
<p>A thief can establish a thief den, attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. These thieves will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the PC will not be able to attract apprentices to replace them. A successful thief might use these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.</p>
