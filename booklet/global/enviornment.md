# Enviornment
This chapter covers how to track light, distance, and similar elements.

## Time
Time is measured in three units. How long these units are is upto the DM.

### Turn
Most adventuring activities, such as having a fight or searching a room take one *turn*. Each *turn*, the DM checks for hazards. 

### Round
A *round* is a short unit of time used during conflict. There are 10 *rounds* in one *turn*.

### Week
Each session, players get one *week's* worth of downtime. 

## Distance
There are three units of distance. 

### Step
A *step* is an abstract measure of distance. Moving from a hallway to a room, or vice versa, is three *steps* under typical conditions.

1. Moving to a door.
2. Crossing a thresholld.
3. Moving into the room.

The following are also one *step*:

- Traversing stairs or a ladder.
- Traversing a simple obstacle.
- Traversing between two *zones*, in a large area.
- Traveling about 4 squares.

### Squares
The exact number of map squares can be counted to determine more exact distance. This is especially helpful if playing on a large battle map.

### Feet
Rarely, distance will be measured in feet, especially in spell descriptions.

## Zones
Ranges and relative location are divided into four *zones*.

### Touch 
Touching distance. In the same square.
### Close
Throwing distance. Speaking distance. About 1 step. About 4 squares.
### Distant
