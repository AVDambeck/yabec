# Experience
This chapter covers experience points (XP) and how it is awarded. XP is a measure of a PC's power and wealth, and creates progression.

## Score Sheet
One player acts as LINK. They keep a written list of *scores* (anything that awards XP).

At the end of the session, the Score Keeper will confer with the DM to confirm each score, and establish the total amount of XP. 

XP is divided evenly between all surviving characters. The Score Keeper will announce the individual amount gained.

### Prime Requisite
Each class has one or two prime requisites, which grants bonus XP for having a high *ability score*. 

Characters with at least a 9 in one prime requisite gain 5% extra XP. 

Characters with at least a 9 in both gain 15% extra XP.

### Minions
If players are 2nd level or higher, their minions  gain the same amount of XP. 

## Scores
A *score* is anything that awards XP.

### Treasure.
Recovering treasure from a dungeon scores 1 XP per 1 cp value of the treasure.

Recovering a magic item scores 1000 XP.

### Goal
Achieving a *goal* scores 100 XP per character involved.  LINK

### Session Report
Writing a session report awarsds 100 XP to the writer. 

### Defeated Monster 
Defeating monsters scores XP based on their HD, plus a bonus for each special ability. e.g. a 2+2 HD monster with an ability is worth 35 XP.

| 3+        | 50	| 25    |
| 4	        | 75	| 50    |
| 4+        | 125	| 75    |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 5, 5+     | 200	| 150   |
| 6, 6+, 7  | 300	| 250   |
| 7+, 8, 8+ | 650	| 550   |
| ≥9        | 1000	| 700   |

### Mapping
Mapping a complete dungeon level scores XP equal to 1000 times the depth of the level.

## Leveling Up
When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player  consults the character’s class and notes any improvements in saving throws, AV, spells, etc. 

They also roll their health (see page 18). LINK

### One Session Maximum
Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level are lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level.
