# Life & Death
This section covers health, damage, and dying.

## Health Points
Health points (HP) represent the ability to withstand injury and exaustion.

### Health Die (HD)
Health dice are used to determine HP. Each class has a diferent HD. Monsters have a d8 HD.

### Rolliing Health
When leveling up, roll a number of HD equal to your level. Add the bonus from *constitution* times your level. If the new total is greater than your current HP, it becomes your new HP.

## Damage
Damage represents injury, exaustion, and wear. 

### Slain
When a creature takes damage equal to or greater tan its HP, it is *slain*,

*Slain* minions and monsters instantly die. *Slain* PCs are *near death*; if not healed within one *turn*, they will die.

#### Destruction
if *slain* by fire, explosion, or magic, PCs instantly die and items are destroyed. 

Magic items have a chance of miraculously surviving.

#### Subdual
If the final attack on a creature is made with a blunt weapon, they can be left non-leathally incapacitated, and *bad* undtil a *shift*.

### Item Damage
Some items can become damaged. Items with four or more damage break completely. Magic items are immune to damage.

Each point of damage incurs a penalty:

- **Weapons:** -1 to damage.
- **Armor:** +1 to AC.
- **Other:** -1 to any rolls made with it.

Dwarves are able to repair items. See page X. LINK

## Healing
Healing removes damage.

### Natural Healing
One week of downtime heals 2d6.

### Bandaging
Bandages can be applied to injuries less than 3 turns old.

Make an *intelligence* check. If you succeed, heal 1d6.

**Restriction:** Bandaging takes one turn, and consumes a bandage. Each injury can only be bandaged once.

You may bandage yourself.

### Magical Healing
Magic potions or spells can provid instantaneous healing.

When magically healing a *slain* character, they *dismember* with advantage.

## Saving Throws
All characters and monsters can make *saves* to avoid the full effects of certain traps, spells, and attacks.

### Catagories:
There are five saving throw catagories:

- **Death (D):** When targeted by a death ray, or exposed to poison.
- **Weird (W):** When exposed to radiation or other worlds.
- **Paralysis or Petrification (P):** When targeted by an efect that paralyses or turns to stone.
- **Blast (B):** When target by dragon breath or explosions.
- **Spells or magic (S)** When targeted by a banefull spell or effect from a magic item. 

Each class has its own table denoting the *save* values based on the level. Monsters have their own table, see page X. LINK

### Checking
You succeed if d20 >= *save* value. 

Success against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved. Otherwise, the effect has been entierly avoided or negated.

## Near Death
Between life and death, there is a terrible void.

### Death
After a full turn *near death*, characters die. 

If a character takes any damage while *near death*, they die.

### Dismemberment
When healed in *near death*, a character rolls for *dismemberment*. Roll a d20, and subtract *constitution*. Reference the table. If they survive, they heal 1.

| Result | Dismeberment                     |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| <=1    | Unharmed                         |
| 2-3    | Broken rib: -1d4 *constitution*  |
| 4      | Bone fracture: -1d4 *strength*   |
| 5      | Torn muscle: -1d4 *dexterity*    |
| 6      | Concussion: -1d4 *wisdom* and *intelligence* |
| 7      | Lost eye                         |
| 8      | Lost arm                         |
| 9      | Broken leg: +2 AC                |
| >=10   | Dead!                            |

## After Death
### Burial
Simple burial prevents the vody from being reanimated.

Temples will burry and bless the dead for free.

Creamation prevents reanimation and is impossible to undo.

#### Rites
If a cleric uses one turn to preform a blessing, the soul will pass peacefully.

When funerary rites are preformed, the character sheet must be ripped up. Players are encouraged to give eulogy, play music, and create intricate rituals.

### Inheritance
When a character dies, their companions can loot their body.

Money and items stored in town will be subject to a 15% estate tax to local government or temple, and then inherited by the next of kin or listed heir.

### Resurrection
Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two weeks of bed rest, they have 1 HP, move at half the normal rate, can not carry *heavy*  items, cannot attack, cast spells, or use class skills. 

Each time a character is resurrected, their *constitution* is reduced by 1.
