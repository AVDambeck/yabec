## Travel 
The Dungeon Master will present an overworld map with one or more dugeons, an possibly other towns. 

### Deciding a destination
Any player can contribute to the discussion of what dungeon to go to. However, only one player needs to *chart* the journey. 

Unopinionated players can simply follow the party to whichever dungeon they go to.

### Charting
One players *charts* the journey to a dungeon or town. Its suggest that this player be the *quater master*. See page X.

1. Count the number of *hexes* between the party's current location, and the destination. 
2. Count the number of *hexes* to a town. 
3. (optional) If crossing an *obsticle*, such as a river, add each to the count. 
4. For each player and minion, aquire a ration for each *hex*. 
5. (optional) If crossing a body of water, also aquire the fare for passage on a boat.

Best practice is to have each participating player compensate the *quarter master* for their rations.

### Departing
Once all players have annouced they are ready to *depart*, the players travel to their destination. 

If it is a dungoen, the being *dungeon*.

If it is a different town, simply continue *town* in the new location.
